## Imperial Nobility & Black Orc Balls

**Gem-encrusted Ball**

A Gem-encrusted Ball is treated like a normal ball, and therefore is not replaced at the end of drive like other special types of ball.

Instead, when a player scores a touchdown with a Gem-encrusted Ball, roll a D6. On a 5+, that player's team sells the ball to sell on later; their team gains an additional D6x10,000 gold pieces during the post-game sequence. Once this condition has been met, the Gem-encrusted Ball is no longer in use and the rules for normal balls are used for the remainder of the game.

**Welded Steel Ball**

Players in possession of a Welded Steel Ball may not attempt to make a Long pass or a Long bomb â€“ the ball is simply far too heavy to throw that far! Additionally, if a model fails to catch a Welded Steel Ball following a Pass action, the ball will hit them square on the head. Make an Armour roll for that player. Then scatter the ball from that player's square.

Additionally, players with the Stunty or Titchy traits reduce their Move Allowance by 1 whilst they are in possession of a Welded Steel Ball.
