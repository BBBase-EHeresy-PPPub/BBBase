## INTRODUCTION

Welcome to Blitz Bowl! The fast-paced, sports-based game of gladiatorial mayhem where teams of budding Blood Bowl rookies aim to test their mettle by participating in the Crush in the hopes of being discovered and whisked away to the fame and fortune of the big leagues!  

Each player is a coach in charge of a team competing against their opponent to score as many points as possible by scoring touchdowns and completing challenges. If, at the start of your turn, you are 10 or more points ahead, then you immediately win the game! Otherwise, the game carries on until there are no more challenges left to complete, at which point the team with the most points wins and receives their hard-earned moment of triumph!
