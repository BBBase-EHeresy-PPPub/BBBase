*"Well Jim, it looks like these rookies are ones to keep an eye on!"*

*"That's right Bob, they've got the hustle of an expert team, despite being green around the ears. I can't wait to see what they can do on the gridiron!"*

*"Well Jim, as long as it's plenty violent, I'm happy!"*

*"You would be Bob, you would be."*

**Raw Talent**

Discard this card after you make an Armour Check, a Throw Check, or roll the Block Dice for a Block Action made by a Player from your team. Re-roll the dice.
