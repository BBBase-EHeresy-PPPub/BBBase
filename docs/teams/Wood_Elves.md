Team Mascot
30K
A team that includes a Team Mascot gains an extra team re-roll (a suitable model should be placed on your team reroll tracker). However, to use the Team Mascot re-roll you must first roll a D6:
On a roll of 1-4, the Team Mascot proves ineffective and, pelted by food wrappers and worse, retreats to the locker room. The Team Mascot re-roll is lost for this half of the game. However, you may use a normal team re-roll instead.
On a roll of 5+, the Team Mascot re-roll can be used, just like a normal team re-roll.

You may Induce Mercenary players to your team for a single game, chosen from your Team Roster, at 30,000 gold pieces more than the player would normally cost. The normal limits on the total number of players allowed on a team and in each position apply to Mercenaries. However, players that are missing the game due to injury do not count towards the number of players on the team, so they are not counted when working out how many Mercenaries a team can have. All Mercenaries have the Loner (4+) trait. In addition, a Mercenary may be given one additional Primary skill selected from those available to a player of that position, at an additional cost of 50,000 gold pieces. Mercenaries do not earn Star Player points and cannot be awarded the MVP for the game. Unlike Journeymen, Mercenaries cannot be permanently hired during the post-game sequence.
Galandril Silverwater
40K
GO TEAM!
Each time Galandril’s team rolls Cheering Fans on the Kick-off Event table, add D3 to the number of cheerleaders the team has – if the team does not have any cheerleaders, it counts as having one. In addition, each time Galandril’s team makes a roll on the Prayers to Nuffle table, if a natural 15 or 16 is rolled on the D16 (or, if a D8 is being rolled as in exhibition play, if a natural 8 is rolled), the team gains an additional team re-roll.

Kari counts as two Temp Agency Cheerleaders. 
In addition, if her team cannot set up 11 players at the start of a drive, Kari may decide to “show ‘em how it’s done!”. 
Her team’s coach can choose to set her up as part of the team. 
If they do so, she counts as part of the team for the duration of the drive, and no longer counts as two Temp Agency Cheerleaders. 
When the drive ends, Kari is Sent-off. You cannot Argue the Call or use a Bribe to prevent this. 
She will play no further part in the game – she does not count as any Temp Agency Cheerleaders, and she cannot be used in a later drive.
Medicinal Unguent

Should a player on your team be removed from play having suffered a 10-12, Serious Injury result on the Casualty table, after any other attempts to heal that player have been made and have failed, you may use this Inducement. The player is immediately removed from the Casualty box and placed in the Reserves box of your dugout, having been miraculously healed by the liberal application of something that smells extremely suspicious. However, at the end of this game, the result of the Casualty roll is applied as normal.

The trundlefoot triplets (Biased Referee)
80K
HEAVY-HANDED INCOMPETENCE
The Trundlefoot Triplets often try their best to partake in a bit of honest corruption, but all too often they fail. If any player on the opposing team commits a Foul but a double is not rolled when making either the Armour roll or Injury roll, roll a D6:
On a roll of 5+, the player that committed the Foul is Sent-off, exactly as if they had rolled a double (i.e., the opposing coach may use a Bribe if one is available and may attempt to Argue the Call).
On a roll of 2-4, the triplets, squabbling amongst themselves, miss the Foul.
On a roll of 1, however, the victim of the Foul is Sent-off as if they had committed a Foul and rolled a double!
"SMART PLAYERS ARE WELL-BEHAVED PLAYERS!"
At the start of each drive, after both teams are set-up but before the kick-off, roll a D6. On a roll of 6, one randomly selected player on the opposing team that is not being Marked becomes embroiled in a pointless argument with the triplets about their kit. The player is immediately Placed Prone and becomes Stunned, representing the time wasted arguing.
"THEY DON’T LOOK HAPPY!"
If a Get the Ref result is rolled on the Kick-off Event table, the triplets make themselves scarce and will play no further part in this game. In addition, each team also gets a Bribe as normal.
Schielund Scharlitan
90K
I’LL MAKE YOU A STAR!
During the pre-game sequence, after Step 4 but before Step 5, randomly select D3 players on your team that are eligible to play during this game. These players have been approached by Scharlitan, and his interest is having a noticeable effect on their attitude!
Until the end of this game, each selected player gains the Pro skill. However, at the start of Step 3 of the post-game sequence, roll a D6 for each of these players (unless they suffered, and did not recover from, a Casualty table result of 15-16, DEAD during the game):
On a roll of 1, that player has begun to act like they are the next big thing. The agent tires of his client and drops them, but the exposure has gone to their head. The player gains the Loner (2+) trait.
On a roll of 2-5, the agent simply drops the player from his books. They might be disappointed, but they’ll get over it.
On a roll of 6, the agent tires of his client and drops them, but the exposure has been good for them. The player permanently retains the Pro skill without having to spend any SPP (note that you must adjust their Current Value accordingly, as if the player had chosen a Primary skill).
Special Plays
100K
Each Special Plays Inducement purchased gives you one Special Plays card to use during the game ahead. Cards are drawn from one or more of the Special Plays card decks during the Inducements step of the pregame sequence:
Each Special Plays Inducement purchased allows you to draw cards from a single deck.
The deck from which cards are drawn is determined by rolling a D6 and consulting the table below.
For each separate Special Plays Inducement purchased, roll again on the table below.
There is no limit to how many cards may be drawn from each deck, but if the second roll or any subsequent rolls give a duplicated result, you may re-roll the D6. If the D6 is re-rolled, you must accept the result of the re-roll.
Special Plays Cards Roll a D6, and check the following table:
Random Events
Dirty Tricks
Magic Memorabilia
Heroic Feats
Benefits of Training
Miscellaneous Mayhem
CARD SELECTION: Once the D6 has been rolled, the appropriate Special Plays card deck is shuffled and two cards are drawn from the top. You may then read both cards before choosing one to keep and one to discard.
Extra training
100K
offers a Team Reroll that can be used in each half of the game. 
Bribe
100K
Buy up to three bribes. When one of your players is ejected, you may use a bribe to try to cancel the kickout. Roll a D6. If the result is greater than 1, the player stays on the field (there is no turnover). On a 1, the bribe is spent but has no effect. A bribe cannot be used immediately after a referee challenge that led to the coach being sent off.
Wandering Apothecary
100K
If your team allows the use of an apothecary, you can hire up to two wandering apothecaries. Each wandering apothecary behaves like a regular apothecary, for the duration of the match only.

Ayleen Andar
100K
THIS KID HAS REAL POTENTIAL!
If your team took on any Journeymen during Step 3 of the pre-game sequence, Ayleen will ensure that they are the best, and all are eager to impress!
Roll a D6 for each, applying a -1 modifier to the roll for each Journeyman taken on after the first:
On a roll of 1 or less, the Journeyman is a team player, but doesn’t show any particular talent. The Journeyman loses the Loner (4+) trait.
On a roll of 2-5, the Journeyman has some potential. The Journeyman gains a single randomly selected Skill from one of their Primary skill categories.
On a roll of 6, Ayleen has produced a player with real star quality! The Journeyman gains two randomly selected Skills from one of their Primary skill categories.
Each Journeyman counts towards CTV as normal. Their value does not increase for any Skills they may have. Journeymen provided by Ayleen may be permanently hired during Step 4 of the post-game sequence as normal, but doing so will cost an additional 10,000 gold pieces per Skill.
Biased Referee
120K
CLOSE SCRUTINY
If any player on the opposing team commits a Foul without rolling a double when making either the Armour roll or Injury roll, roll a D6:
On a roll of 5+, the Biased Referee spots the Foul and the player is Sent-off, exactly as if they had rolled a double (i.e., the opposing coach may use a Bribe if one is available and may attempt to Argue the Call).
On a roll of 1-4, the player manages to avoid the ref’s attention.
I DIDN’T SEE A THING!
When rolling on the Argue the Call table, you may apply a +1 modifier to the dice roll.
Jorm the Ogre (Biased Referee)
120K
JORM DOESN’T LIKE CHEATERS!
Jorm is always on the lookout for dirty play, and misses very little. If any player on the opposing team commits a Foul but a double is not rolled when making either the Armour roll or Injury roll, roll a D6:
On a roll of 4+, Jorm has spotted the cheat and rolls up his sleeves to deliver his own form of justice.
On a roll of 1-3, the player manages to avoid the ref’s attention.
Once spotted by Jorm in this way (and only in this way), the player that committed the Foul is immediately Knocked Down. When a player is Knocked Down by Jorm, you may apply a +1 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll. This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made.
"SHUT IT, YOU HOOLIGANS!"
If a Get the Ref result is rolled on the Kick-off Event table, the normal effects are ignored – instead, Jorm goes into a rampage and starts tearing through the stands to teach the rowdy fans a lesson! Both teams reduce their Fan Factor for this game by -1 each time a Get the Ref result is rolled on the Kick-off Event table.

Asur High Mage (Wizard)
150K
Once per game, a Wizard may cast one of the following spells: 
TEMPORAL DISTORTION
You may cast this spell immediately after any of the opposition’s team turns has ended. Both turn markers must move in the same direction. Declare whether you wish to move the turn markers forwards one space or backwards one space and roll a D6:
On a roll of 5+, the spell is successful and the turn markers are moved.
On a roll of 1-4, the stadium fills with light and the strangely localised effects cause the High Mage to rapidly age or become unexpectedly more youthful, but otherwise the spell has no effect.
 
THUNDERBOLT
You may cast this spell either at the start of any of the opposition’s team turns, before any player is activated, or immediately after any of the opposition’s team turns has ended. Target any Standing opposition player anywhere on the pitch, and roll a D6:
On a roll of 3+, the player has been hit by the Thunderbolt.
On a roll of 1 or 2, the player manages to duck or dodge the attack.
A Standing player hit by a Thunderbolt is Knocked Down. When a player is Knocked Down by a Thunderbolt, you may apply a +1 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll. This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made.
Hireling Sports-Wizard (Wizard)
150K
Once per game, a Hireling Sports-Wizard may cast one of the following spells:
FIREBALL
You may cast this spell at the end of either player's team turn, before the next team turn begins. Choose a target square anywhere on the pitch and roll a D6 for each Standing player (from either team) that occupies either the target square or a square adjacent to it:
On a roll of 4+, the player has been hit by the Fireball.
On a roll of 1-3, the player manages to avoid the Fireball.
Any Standing players hit by the Fireball are Knocked Down. When a player is Knocked Down by a Fireball, you may apply a +1 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll. This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made.
ZAP!
You may cast this spell either at the start of any of the opposition’s team turns, before any player is activated, or immediately after any of the opposition’s team turns has ended. Target any opposition player and roll a D6:
If the roll is equal to or higher than the player’s Strength characteristic, or is a natural 6, that player turns into a frog for the remainder of the drive, after which their coach will secure emergency magical assistance to turn the player back into their original form.
If the roll is lower than the player’s Strength characteristic, the player develops a fresh crop of warts, but the spell has no further effect.
If the player was in possession of the ball when they were turned into a frog, it is dropped and will bounce. When a roll on the Casualty table is required against the frog, no roll is made. Instead, it is automatically treated as if a Badly Hurt result had been rolled. The frog must miss the rest of the game and cannot be patched-up by an apothecary (because it's a frog!). At the end of the game, the player is returned to normal shape with no ill effects.
The frog has the following profile:
5 1 2+ - 5+
Dodge, Leap, No Hands, Stunty, Titchy, Very Long Legs
Horatio X. Schottenheim
150K
Horatio conjures up a fireball spell and flings it with his legendarily poor aim in the general direction of the action on the pitch. 
Horatio may cast this spell immediately after any of the opposition’s team turns has ended. 
Choose a target square anywhere on the pitch. 
The target square is moved D3 squares in a direction determined by rolling a D8 and referring to the Random Direction template. 
After moving the target square, roll a D6 for each Standing player (from either team) that is either in the target square or a square adjacent to it:
On a roll of 4+, the player has been hit by the Fireball.
On a roll of 1-3, the player manages to avoid the Fireball.
Any Standing players hit by the Fireball are Knocked Down. 
When a player is Knocked Down by a Fireball, you may apply a +1 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll. 
This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made.
Druchii Sports Sorceress (Wizard)
150K
Once per game, a Wizard may cast one of the following spells:
THUNDERBOLT
You may cast this spell either at the start of any of the opposition’s team turns, before any player is activated, or immediately after any of the opposition’s team turns has ended. Target any Standing opposition player anywhere on the pitch, and roll a D6:
On a roll of 3+, the player has been hit by the Thunderbolt.
On a roll of 1 or 2, the player manages to duck or dodge the attack.
A Standing player hit by a Thunderbolt is Knocked Down. When a player is Knocked Down by a Thunderbolt, you may apply a +1 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll. This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made.
ONE THOUSAND CUTS
You may cast this spell at the start of any of the opposition’s team turns, before any player is activated. Target any opposition player anywhere on the pitch, and roll a D6:
On a roll of 3+, the player is hit by a swirling storm of incorporeal dark magic.
On a roll of 1 or 2, the magic engulfs the player briefly before the spell dissipates harmlessly.
Until the end of this drive, the MA, ST, and AG characteristics of a player hit by One Thousand Cuts are reduced by 1.
Halfling Master Chef
300K
At the Kick-Off of each half (before the roll on the Table), roll 3D6: for each result of 4 or more, offers 1 re-roll and removes one re-roll from the opponent for the rest of the half.

Enslaved Giants are big... Much bigger than Ogres, Minotaurs, Trolls, or any of the other Big Arms you might regularly encounter at a Blood Bowl stadium.
Always occupies 4 squares (Standing, Grounded or Stunned), if 1 of these squares is in the tackle area of 1 opponent, it is "Marked";
Imprints no tackle zone on the 4 squares behind his back (the coach must turn him in the direction he wishes during his movement, at the end of his movement and after following a "Pushed") but remains a victim of the effects applying to these 4 squares;
Cannot move onto a square where a player is standing, but can move onto a square where a player is "Down" (but not stay there) without having to "Step over". If he falls onto 1 square occupied by 1 "Down" player, the latter suffers 1 "Push Back";
If part of his base is off the pitch, he is drawn into the crowd;
