You may Induce Mercenary players to your team for a single game, chosen from your Team Roster, at 30,000 gold pieces more than the player would normally cost. The normal limits on the total number of players allowed on a team and in each position apply to Mercenaries. However, players that are missing the game due to injury do not count towards the number of players on the team, so they are not counted when working out how many Mercenaries a team can have. All Mercenaries have the Loner (4+) trait. In addition, a Mercenary may be given one additional Primary skill selected from those available to a player of that position, at an additional cost of 50,000 gold pieces. Mercenaries do not earn Star Player points and cannot be awarded the MVP for the game. Unlike Journeymen, Mercenaries cannot be permanently hired during the post-game sequence.
Master of Ballistics
40K
During Step 2 of every Start of Drive sequence, the Master of Ballistics can attempt to advise the kicker. 
After placing the ball but before rolling for deviation, roll a D3 on the table opposite: 
1 Complete Misunderstanding: The kicker has rather missed the point, and the kick-off deviates as normal.
2 Interesting Theory... The Master of Ballistics becomes side-tracked explaining the theory and runs out of time before the whistle. The distance the ball deviates is reduced by one square, from D6 squares to D6-1 squares (meaning there is a chance it won’t deviate at all if a 1 is rolled).
3 Successful Practical Application: By Nuffle, the kicker’s grasped it! After rolling the dice for deviation, the kicking team’s coach can choose to modify the roll of either the D6 or the D8 by +1 or +2, or -1 or -2 as they wish, to a minimum of 1, and a maximum of 6 (for the D6) and 8 (for the D8).
Bloodweiser Kegs

Up to 2 kegs can be bought to provide +1 per keg to KO recovery rolls.

Kari counts as two Temp Agency Cheerleaders. 
In addition, if her team cannot set up 11 players at the start of a drive, Kari may decide to “show ‘em how it’s done!”. 
Her team’s coach can choose to set her up as part of the team. 
If they do so, she counts as part of the team for the duration of the drive, and no longer counts as two Temp Agency Cheerleaders. 
When the drive ends, Kari is Sent-off. You cannot Argue the Call or use a Bribe to prevent this. 
She will play no further part in the game – she does not count as any Temp Agency Cheerleaders, and she cannot be used in a later drive.
Dwarfen Runesmith
50K
During each Start of Drive sequence, after Step 2 but before Step 3, you can select a single player on your team that is currently on the pitch that does not have the Loner (X+) trait and choose one of the following runes. Then roll a D6:
On a roll of 4+, the rune takes effect, but you cannot attempt to use the Runesmith again at the start of a later drive.
On a roll of 2 or 3, the rune does not work, but you can attempt to use the Runesmith again at the start of a later drive.
On a roll of 1, the rune does not work, and you cannot attempt to use the Runesmith again at the start of a later drive.
DWARFEN RUNES
Rune of Might
Until the end of this drive, the chosen player gains the Mighty Blow (+1) skill.
Rune of Fury
Until the end of this drive, the chosen player gains both the Dauntless and Frenzy skills.
Rune of Speed
Until the end of this drive, the chosen player gains both the Sprint and Sure Feet skills.
Rune of Iron
Until the end of this drive, the chosen player’s Armour Value is increased by 1 (to a maximum of 11+) and they gain the Stand Firm skill.
Rune of Impact
Until the end of this drive, the chosen player gains both the Juggernaut and Horns skills.
Medicinal Unguent
60K
Should a player on your team be removed from play having suffered a 10-12, Serious Injury result on the Casualty table, after any other attempts to heal that player have been made and have failed, you may use this Inducement. The player is immediately removed from the Casualty box and placed in the Reserves box of your dugout, having been miraculously healed by the liberal application of something that smells extremely suspicious. However, at the end of this game, the result of the Casualty roll is applied as normal.

Mungo Spinecracker
80K
I’M FINE THANKS, MUNGO!
Whenever a player on your team suffers an Injury result of 8-9, KO’d (or of 7-8, KO’d on the Stunty Injury table), you may roll a D6 before removing them from play:
On a roll of 1, the player’s protestations fall upon deaf ears and Mungo ‘treats’ his patient. The player becomes a casualty and is immediately removed from play and placed in the Casualty box of their team dugout. No Casualty roll is made. Instead, a Badly Hurt result is automatically applied against them.
On a roll of 2-4, the player is badly pummelled but suffers neither lasting harm nor noticeable benefit. The player is removed from play and placed in the Knocked-out box of your team dugout as normal.
On a roll of 5 or 6, the player regains their senses remarkably quickly and is able to fend off the ministrations of the Orc. The player remains on the pitch and becomes Stunned.
Halfling Pot Pot
80K
A Hot Pot can be used once per game, launching a cauldron of piping-hot stew onto the opposition. The Hot Pot may be used immediately after any of the opposition’s team turns has ended. Choose a target square anywhere on the pitch and roll a D6:
On a roll of 6, the shot is on target.
On a roll of 2-5, the shot is off target – the target square is moved D3 squares in a direction determined by rolling a D8 and referring to the Random Direction template.
On a roll of 1, something has gone horribly wrong and the Hot Pot has misfired in the team dugout. D3 randomly selected players in the Reserves box immediately become KO’d and moved to the Knockedout box.
A player in the target square is automatically hit by the Hot Pot itself. If a Standing player is hit, they are Knocked Down. If a Prone or Stunned player is hit, an Armour roll is made against them. In either case, you may apply a +2 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll. This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made. Additionally, roll a D6 for each Standing player (from either team) that is in a square adjacent to the target square:
On a roll of 4+, the player has been hit by the mess of stew that showers out of the Hot Pot.
On a roll of 1-3, the player manages to avoid being hit. Any Standing player hit in this way is Placed Prone.
Special Plays
100K
Each Special Plays Inducement purchased gives you one Special Plays card to use during the game ahead. Cards are drawn from one or more of the Special Plays card decks during the Inducements step of the pregame sequence:
Each Special Plays Inducement purchased allows you to draw cards from a single deck.
The deck from which cards are drawn is determined by rolling a D6 and consulting the table below.
For each separate Special Plays Inducement purchased, roll again on the table below.
There is no limit to how many cards may be drawn from each deck, but if the second roll or any subsequent rolls give a duplicated result, you may re-roll the D6. If the D6 is re-rolled, you must accept the result of the re-roll.
Special Plays Cards Roll a D6, and check the following table:
Random Events
Dirty Tricks
Magic Memorabilia
Heroic Feats
Benefits of Training
Miscellaneous Mayhem
CARD SELECTION: Once the D6 has been rolled, the appropriate Special Plays card deck is shuffled and two cards are drawn from the top. You may then read both cards before choosing one to keep and one to discard.
Extra training
100K
offers a Team Reroll that can be used in each half of the game. 
Bribe
100K
Buy up to three bribes. When one of your players is ejected, you may use a bribe to try to cancel the kickout. Roll a D6. If the result is greater than 1, the player stays on the field (there is no turnover). On a 1, the bribe is spent but has no effect. A bribe cannot be used immediately after a referee challenge that led to the coach being sent off.
Wandering Apothecary
100K
If your team allows the use of an apothecary, you can hire up to two wandering apothecaries. Each wandering apothecary behaves like a regular apothecary, for the duration of the match only.

Ayleen Andar
100K
THIS KID HAS REAL POTENTIAL!
If your team took on any Journeymen during Step 3 of the pre-game sequence, Ayleen will ensure that they are the best, and all are eager to impress!
Roll a D6 for each, applying a -1 modifier to the roll for each Journeyman taken on after the first:
On a roll of 1 or less, the Journeyman is a team player, but doesn’t show any particular talent. The Journeyman loses the Loner (4+) trait.
On a roll of 2-5, the Journeyman has some potential. The Journeyman gains a single randomly selected Skill from one of their Primary skill categories.
On a roll of 6, Ayleen has produced a player with real star quality! The Journeyman gains two randomly selected Skills from one of their Primary skill categories.
Each Journeyman counts towards CTV as normal. Their value does not increase for any Skills they may have. Journeymen provided by Ayleen may be permanently hired during Step 4 of the post-game sequence as normal, but doing so will cost an additional 10,000 gold pieces per Skill.
Biased Referee
120K
CLOSE SCRUTINY
If any player on the opposing team commits a Foul without rolling a double when making either the Armour roll or Injury roll, roll a D6:
On a roll of 5+, the Biased Referee spots the Foul and the player is Sent-off, exactly as if they had rolled a double (i.e., the opposing coach may use a Bribe if one is available and may attempt to Argue the Call).
On a roll of 1-4, the player manages to avoid the ref’s attention.
I DIDN’T SEE A THING!
When rolling on the Argue the Call table, you may apply a +1 modifier to the dice roll.

Ranulf 'Red' Hokuli (Biased Referee)
130K
'RED' CARD
When suitably remunerated, Ranulf will keep a particularly close eye on one of the teams. If any player on the opposing team commits a Foul but a double is not rolled when making either the Armour roll or Injury roll, roll a D6:
On a roll of 4+, Ranulf loudly demands that play halt whilst he investigates further.
On a roll of 1-3, the player manages to avoid the ref’s attention.
Once spotted by Ranulf in this way (and only in this way), the coach of the player that committed the Foul must choose one of the following options:
The coach may use a Bribe if one is available.
The player that committed the Foul may accept their fate and be Sent-off.
The player may attempt to argue with Ranulf! Ranulf will settle the argument with his axe. An Armour roll is made against the player, applying a +2 modifier to the result:
- If the roll is higher than the Armour Value of the player, they become Prone and an Injury roll is made against them. The player is not Sent-off and no Turnover is caused.
- If the roll is equal to or lower than the Armour Value of the player hit, the attack has no effect. The player is Sent-off and a Turnover caused.
"I'M NOT ONE FOR ARGUING!"
If Ranulf has been Induced for this game, even if he does not take part due to both coaches Inducing him, neither coach can Argue the Call – even the most argumentative of coaches can’t help but have respect for the charismatic Norscan.
Wicked Witch (Wizard)
150K
Once per game, a Wizard may cast one of the following spells:
ZAP!
You may cast this spell either at the start of any of the opposition’s team turns, before any player is activated, or immediately after any of the opposition’s team turns has ended. Target any opposition player and roll a D6:
If the roll is equal to or higher than the player’s Strength characteristic, or is a natural 6, that player turns into a frog for the remainder of the drive, after which their coach will secure emergency magical assistance to turn the player back into their original form.
If the roll is lower than the player’s Strength characteristic, the player develops a fresh crop of warts, but the spell has no further effect.
If the player was in possession of the ball when they were turned into a frog, it is dropped and will bounce. When a roll on the Casualty table is required against the frog, no roll is made. Instead, it is automatically treated as if a Badly Hurt result had been rolled. The frog must miss the rest of the game and cannot be patched-up by an apothecary (because it's a frog!). At the end of the game, the player is returned to normal shape with no ill effects.
The frog has the following profile:
MA5 ST1 AG2+ PA- AV5+
Skills : Dodge, Leap, No Hands, Stunty, Titchy, Very Long Legs
PLAGUE OF WARTS
You may cast this spell at the start of any of the opposition’s team turns, before any player is activated. Target any opposition player anywhere on the pitch, and roll a D6:
On a roll of 3+, the player is hit and their skin unexpectedly erupts into a mass of warts.
On a roll of 1 or 2, the player develops a few unsightly blemishes, but is otherwise unaffected.
Until the end of this drive, the MA, ST, and AG characteristics of a player hit by Plague of Warts are reduced by 1. Additionally, until the end of this drive, a player hit by Plague of Warts gains the Disturbing Presence and Foul Appearance skills.
Halfling Master Chef

At the Kick-Off of each half (before the roll on the Table), roll 3D6: for each result of 4 or more, offers 1 re-roll and removes one re-roll from the opponent for the rest of the half.

Enslaved Giants are big... Much bigger than Ogres, Minotaurs, Trolls, or any of the other Big Arms you might regularly encounter at a Blood Bowl stadium.
Always occupies 4 squares (Standing, Grounded or Stunned), if 1 of these squares is in the tackle area of 1 opponent, it is "Marked";
Imprints no tackle zone on the 4 squares behind his back (the coach must turn him in the direction he wishes during his movement, at the end of his movement and after following a "Pushed") but remains a victim of the effects applying to these 4 squares;
Cannot move onto a square where a player is standing, but can move onto a square where a player is "Down" (but not stay there) without having to "Step over". If he falls onto 1 square occupied by 1 "Down" player, the latter suffers 1 "Push Back";
If part of his base is off the pitch, he is drawn into the crowd;
He can reroll Fubmle during a Teammate's Throw;
It reduces malus by 2 for "Interfering with the Pass";
1D12 is used instead of D8 for bounce.
