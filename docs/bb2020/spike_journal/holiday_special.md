## EXHIBITION GAME SPECIAL RULES

This Exhibition Game uses a standard Blood Bowl pitch with additional special rules and alternate victory conditions. Teams are built using the standard rules for Exhibition Games found in the Blood Bowl rulebook. When setting up the pitch, players take it in turns to place up to five Gingerbread Houses each on the pitch; these occupy one or more squares and are covered by the special rules described later.

In addition, 8 squares in each End Zone are occupied by a Snowgrot. Place 8 suitable markers in each End Zone, in alternate squares to represent the Snowgrots. Players can move freely into squares occupied by a Snowgrot and they have no effect on the game save for when a Touchdown is scored, as described in the rules below.

**Gingerbread Houses:**

Gingerbread houses occupy a number of squares on the pitch represented by a model or other suitable indicator. No player can move into a square occupied by a house - if they would, they stop in the square they were moving from.

If a ball stops in a square occupied by a house following a bounce, scatter or deviation, place the Throw-in template so that the Blood Bowl logo is over that square and so it is pointing towards the closest End Zone, then roll a D6.

The ball will be placed in the square corresponding to the roll, as determined by the Throw-in template - repeat this process until the ball lands in a square not occupied by a house.

If a player occupies a square adjacent to a wall when they would be pushed back as a result of a Block action, and there are no squares they can be pushed into, the player will be pushed into the house. If a player is pushed into a house, their Coach rolls a D6. On a 1-3, the player remains where they are with no lasting effect. On a 4+, the player will Fall Over in the square they are in; make an Armour roll as normal.

Note that if a player is pushed into the wall as a result of a POW!, do not roll a D6 to see if they Fall Over - they automatically Fall Over in the square they were in.

**Explosive Touchdowns:**

When a player scores a Touchdown, the ball explodes. Roll a D6 for the player. On a 6+ they manage to escape getting blown up and nothing happens. Otherwise, make an Injury roll for the player, as their glorious moment explodes in their face.

In addition, roll a D6 for each Snowgrot within 3 squares of the square in which the Touchdown was scored. On a 3+, the Snowgrot explodes into a shower of powdery snow and is removed from the pitch. On a 1-2, the Snowgrot withstands the explosion and remains on the pitch.

At the end of the game, the team that has destroyed the most Snowgrots is the winner.

### USING THE RED GOBBO

If both coaches agree, The Red Gobbo can be hired as a Star Player during Exhibition Play. He cannot be used in either League Play or Matched Play.

## NEW SKILL

**THROW SNOWBALL**

During this Exhibition Match, all players gain the Throw Snowball skill.

When activated this player may perform a Throw Snowball action. The player may move before performing the action following all the normal movement rules, but once the snowball has been thrown their activation comes to an end.

Choose a single opposition player within five squares of this player. A player can only be targeted by the Throw Snowball Skill once per turn. The player performing this action make a Passing Ability test, applying the following modifiers if relevant:

- If the target player is more than three squares away, apply a -1 modifier.
- If the target player is in the Tackle Zone of one or more players from their team, apply a -1 modifier as their friends get in the way.
- If the player performing this action is Marked, apply a -1 modifier.

If the Passing Ability test is passed, then the snowball hits the target. Make an Armour roll against the target, applying a +2 modifier to the roll if the player performing the action has a ST of 5 or more.

- If the Armour of the target player is broken, they become Prone.
- If the Armour of the target player is not broken, then nothing else happens.

If a natural 1 is rolled for the Passing Ability test, the player performing this action slips in their enthusiasm to throw the snowball. The throwing player becomes Prone.

## Winter Wonderland Weather Table

| 2D6 | Weather Condition |
|-----|-------------------|
| 2   | **Squigalanche**: At the start of each team's turn, roll a D6. On a 1, randomly select one player from the active team. That player is bitten by a rampant squig; make an Armour roll. If passed, make an Injury roll as normal. This does **not** cause a Turnover, even if the player with the ball is Knocked Down. |
| 3   | **Frozen Snow**: When a player Falls Over or is Knocked Down, the opposing coach applies a +1 modifier when making an Armour roll against them. |
| 4‑10| **Perfect(ish) Conditions**: No additional effect. |
| 11  | **Cold Snap**: At the start of each team's turn, the coach randomly selects a player on the pitch. That player's MA is reduced to 0 until the end of the turn (they may still Rush as normal). |
| 12  | **Blizzard**: Apply a -1 modifier each time a player attempts to Rush an extra square. Only Quick and Short passes may be attempted. |

## Holiday Friendly Injury Table

**This table applies for all players, even if they have the Stunty Trait.**

| 2D6 | Result |
|-----|--------|
| 2‑7 | **Stunned**: The player is immediately Stunned and laid face-down on the pitch. |
| 8‑9 | **KO'd**: The player is removed from play and placed in the Knocked-out box of their team dugout. At the end of each drive, KO'd players may recover as per the Blood Bowl rulebook (p.66). |
| 10+ | **Switch!**: *As decreed by the Red Gobbo and his rulez*, the injured player must **switch sides**. Remove them from play and place them in the Reserves box of the opposing team. They count as part of that team's roster for the rest of the game (even above 16 players). |

## Winter Wonderland Kick-off Event Table

| 2D6 | Kick-off Event |
|-----|----------------|
| 2 | **The More the Merrier!**: The kicking team's Coach rolls a D3 then, starting with the kicking team, each Coach may choose to remove up to that many extra players from their Reserves box and set them up on the pitch, even if this takes the number of players above 11. These players may not be placed on the Line of Scrimmage or in a Wide Zone. |
| 3 | **It's a Miracle!**: All players in a team's Knocked-out box suddenly recover and are immediately placed in the Reserve box. If a team has fewer than 11 players on the pitch for this drive, the Coach may place players from their Reserves box onto the field to make up the difference. Players placed this way may be placed anywhere in their team's half, but not in either of the Wide Zones. |
| 4 | **Avalanche**: Randomly determine one of the two Wide Zones. All players in that Wide Zone are placed Prone and become Stunned. |
| 5 | **Hold On a Minute!**: The kicking team's Coach rolls a D3 then each Coach randomly selects that many of their players on the pitch. These players switch to the opposing team — for all intents and purposes, they are part of the opposing team's roster for the remainder of the game. Remove the players from the pitch then, starting with the kicking team, the Coach sets up the players on the pitch, following all normal set-up rules. |
| 6 | **Cheering Villagers**: Apply the Cheering Fans result as normal. |
| 7 | **Motivational Speeches**: Apply the Brilliant Coaching result as normal. |
| 8 | **Snow Business**: Make a new roll on the Winter Wonderland Weather Table. If the result is 'Perfect(ish) Conditions', the ball will scatter before landing. |
| 9 | **Flash Unfreeze**: Apply the Quick Snap result as normal. |
| 10 | **Get 'em**: Apply the Blitz result as normal. |
| 11 | **Roaming Yhetees**: Both coaches immediately gain a Yhetee for the duration of the drive. Teams can exceed 11 players for this drive. Yhetees can be placed anywhere in their team's half but not in the Wide Zones. At the end of the drive, the Yhetees wander back into the forest. |
| 12 | **Snowball Surprise**: Both Coaches roll a D6. The Coach with the highest roll, or both if tied, chooses one of their players on the pitch. Chosen players gain the [Bombardier] skill for the remainder of the Drive. |
