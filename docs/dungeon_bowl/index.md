o/

)S,

\< here are many different variations of Blood Bowl played in the Old
World, but perhaps the strangest is that of Dungeon Bowl. For years,
Wizards and spellcasters have been embroiled in much debate about which
of their Colleges of Magic is the greatest, and Dungeon Bowl is used as
a different, yet exciting, way of attempting to settle the matter
without involving the general population (who often end up worse off
when Wizards cannot agree!).

***DUNGEON TILES:*** These are the tiles that are used to create the
dungeon where the teams will play a game of Dungeon Bowl. They can be
arranged in a selection of different ways, allowing players to create
numerous different dungeon layouts for the games. ***TWO TEAM
DUGOUTS:*** These are used to keep track of game information, such as
which players are ready to enter the dungeon, if any players are Knocked
Out or Injured, and the number of re-rolls a team has
remaining.

***TWO DUNGEON BOWL TEAMS:*** There are eight different Colleges of
Magic, each with their own selection of miniatures that can be used.
Often teams will be made up of multiple races and positions, leading to
some rather unusual combinations being
possible!

***CHEST:*** These are placed around the dungeon, and could contain
either the ball or a booby trap, making for an exciting and
unpredictable game!

***PORTALS:*** These are placed throughout the dungeon and act as a way
for players to attempt to quickly navigate the dungeon, and for teams to
add more players to the dungeon as the game goes
on.

***DICE:*** Dungeon Bowl uses a selection of different types of dice:
regular six-sided dice, block dice, eight-sided dice and 16-sided dice
to bring the action to life.

***MEASURERS & TEMPLATES:*** These are used for passing the ball,
determining how a ball bounces, and so
on.

***THIS RULEBOOK:*** The one you are holding right now! This has all
the information you need to play the game of Dungeon Bowl, as well as
having the rosters for each of the eight Colleges of Magic so you can
start planning your teams right away!

To play a game of Dungeon Bowl, there are a few key items you will
need. So, let's have a look at a game in progress and list the vital
components you'll require to get you
started.

you can't play Dungeon Bowl without a dungeon for the teams to run
around in, get lost in, and fall into its cleverly-hidden
traps!**

**There are a number of different Dungeon tiles, and on these pages we
are going to show you which tile is which so that you know what rooms,
corridors and other places you can use to create your
dungeon.**

**END ZONES**

**(X2 DOUBLE-SIDED)**

Simply put, these tiles are where teams are trying to get the ball in
order to score the game­winning
touchdown.

**CORRIDORS**

These long, thin tiles add to the claustrophobic nature of Dungeon
Bowl, and make it difficult for players to get past the opposition.
There is a total of four double-sided long corridors, two double-sided
T-junction corridors, and two double­sided L-shaped
corridors.

**DID YOU KNOW?**

*The protection spells placed upon*

*the game balls to prevent them being teleported out of the dungeon
only came into place after a game between the Blazing Axes and the
Iron Hawks saw the ball bounce into a portal and seemingly teleport to
elsewhere in the dungeon. It took the colleges nearly three days to
realise that the ball was no longer in the dungeon, and had instead
ended up in the college library.*

*The Magisterium all knew of course, but they were having too much
fun watching the teams beat each other up as they searched for it to
mention anything!*

**THE FOOTSALL**

Arguably, the most important model in the
dungeon!

After the ball has been recovered from one of the chests, when not in
the possession of a player (i.e., when being held and carried by a
player), the football or, more simply, the ball, is placed on the
ground, wholly within one otherwise empty square. When in a player's
possession, it will occupy a place on or adjacent to the base of that
model.

The ball is an essential component in any game of Dungeon Bowl, and
there are a great many ways in which it can be represented, from a
simple token to a painted and based model, the rival of any
player.

**CHESTS**

Speaking of the ball, at the start of any game of Dungeon Bowl, the
ball has been hidden in one of the chests around the
dungeon.

The others contain a rather explosive surprise for anyone who opens
them! The full rules for

chests can be found on page 31.

**CORNER BOUNCES**

Should the ball hit the corner of the dungeon, it'^1,^ direction of
the bounce is determined by placing the Random Direction template as
shown in the diagram and rolling a D3.

**Dungeon bowl dice**

T][he game of Dungeon Bowl uses lour
different types of dice to determine the outcome of various actions and
events. These are often leferred to as 'Muffle's sacred cubes', in
homage to the patron god of Blood Bowl, and in turn Dungeon EJowl
Interestingly (perhaps), not all of these dice are
cubes!

Bouncing off the wall is covered in greater detail on page
43.

\


**BLOCK DICE**

Unique to games of Blood Bowl and Dungeon Bowl' block dice are used to
resolve Block and Blitz actions against opposition players. They are
six-sided dice that feature five unique icons (one is duplicated on two
faces), each representing a different outcome (see page
49).

**D6**

Dungeon Bowl also uses regular six-sided dice, marked 1 to 6. It is
common for the '6' to be replaced by a logo - either that of the game or
a specific team - on many Dungeon Bowl
dice.]

-   

[***D3:*** The rules might also call for a D3 to be rolled, but an
actual three-sided dice is not necessary.To roll a D3, simply roll a
D6 and halve the result, rounding fractions
up.

![](../media/dungeon_bowl/image25.jpg)![](../media/dungeon_bowl/image26.jpg)![](../media/dungeon_bowl/image27.jpg)

**THE RANGE RULER**

This is used when a Pass or Throw Team-mate action is performed, both
to determine range and, in the case of a Pass action, to determine if
any opposition players can attempt to interfere with the
pass.

Pass actions are covered in greater detail on page 40 and Throw
Team-mate actions on page 44.

**D8] -**

An eight-sided dice is often, though not exclusively, used in
conjunction with the Random Direction
template.

**D16] ----**

A 16-sided dice. Less frequently used but no less vital, a D16 is used
for some of the tables in the rules that follow or to select players at
random from within a team.
