The following pages feature the complete list of Skills and Traits available to players. Be they Skills a player starts with, or Skills gained during the course of a league, all players will have a degree of access to General, Agility, Strength and Passing skills, and many will have access to Mutations. Traits are more unique, the result of a player's nature rather than something they can learn.

### SKILL USE

Players that are Standing and have not lost their Tackle Zone can use their Skills or Traits at any time, not just during their own activation. Players that are Prone or Stunned, or that have lost their Tackle Zone for any reason, cannot use any Skills or Traits unless otherwise stated in the Skill or Trait description:

* You can choose to use a Skill or Trait that modifies a dice roll after the dice roll has been made.
* All bonuses and/or modifiers from Skills or Traits can be combined.
* Unless the description states otherwise, a Skill or Trait can be used by more than one player per team turn.
* Unless the description states otherwise, a Skill or Trait can be used multiple times during each team turn.
* Unless a Skill or Trait is marked with an asterisk (\*), its use is not compulsory (i.e., you do not have to use that Skill or Trait if you do not wish to). However, the use of a Skill or Trait marked with an asterisk (\*) is compulsory.

A Bomb can be thrown and caught, and the throw interfered with, just
like a ball, using the Pass actions as described on page 40, with the
following exceptions:

---

A player may not stand up or move before performing a Throw Bomb
action.Bombs do not bounce and can come to rest on the ground in an
occupied square. Should a player fail to catch a Bomb, it will come to
rest on the ground in the square the player occupies.If a Bomb is
fumbled, it will explode immediately in the square occupied by the
player attempting to throw it.If a Bomb comes to rest on the ground in
an empty square or is caught by an opposition player, no Turnover is
caused.A player that is in possession of the ball can still catch a
bomb.Any Skills that can be used when performing a Pass action can also
be used when performing a Throw Bomb Special action, with the exception

If a Bomb is caught by a player in either team, roll a
D6:

On a roll of 4+, the Bomb explodes immediately, as described below.
On a roll of 1-3, that player must throw the Bomb again immediately.

Team-mate actions as described on page
44.

If you declared that this player would perform an action which can only
be performed once per team turn and this player's activation ended
before the action could be completed, the action is considered to have
been performed and no other player on your team may perform the same
action this team turn.

***DECAY\****

However, if the Kick Team-mate Special action is fumbled, the kicked
player is automatically removed from play and an Injury roll is made
against them, treating a Stunned result as a KO'd result (note that, if
the player that performed this action also has the Mighty Blow (+X)
skill, the coach of the opposition team may use that Skill on this
Injury roll). If the kicked player was in possession of the ball when
removed from play, the ball will bounce from the square they
occupied.

If this player suffers a Casualty result on the Injury table, there is
a +1 modifier applied to all rolls made against this player on the
Casualty table.

**HYPNOTIC GAZE**

During their activation, this player may perform a 'Hypnotic Gaze'
Special action. There is no limit to how many players with this Trait
may perform this Special action each team
turn.

To perform a Hypnotic Gaze Special action, nominate a single Standing
opposition player that has not lost their Tackle Zone and that this
player is Marking. Then make an Agility test for this player, applying
a -1 modifier for every player (other than the nominated player) that is
Marking this player. If the test is passed, the nominated player loses
their Tackle Zone until they are next
activated.

performed or a Foul action committed by a player with this Trait that

If you are playing a College of Life team, a new 'Rotter Lineman'
player, drawn from the College of Life roster, can oe placed immediately
in the Reserves box of your team's dugout (this may cause a team to have
more than 16 players for the remainder of this game). During step 4 of
