## THE TEAM TURN

Simply put, a game of Dungeon Bowl is a chaotic and thrilling affair, filled with all kinds of madness that has become synonymous with the game over the years. To make sense of all of the action, the game on the tabletop is broken down into a series of team turns, during which each coach will activate their players one at a time. In this way, the drama of the game is recreated in a manageable and controlled way.

### TEAM TURNS
Once the teams have been set up and the coin toss has determined which team has the first turn, the game continues in a simple sequence of turns in which teams will alternate taking turns beginning with the team that gained the first turn, and continuing until the winning touchdown is scored.

### PICKING UP THE BALL

(see Picking Up The Ball, [page 46 of the *Blood Bowl Rulebook*](../core_rules/the_rules_of_blood_bowl.md#picking-up-the-ball))


## PASSING THE BALL

Often in a game of Dungeon Bowl, players I will throw the ball to each other In order to move it quickly around the labyrinth of corridors and rooms - after all, the ball travels faster when thrown than by a player running with it! Throwers endeavour to pass the ball safely to a team-mate, avoiding the walls and low ceilings of the dungeon, who is in a better position to run with the ball into the opposition I end zone room, or at least try to find it!

### PASS ACTIONS

(see Pass Actions, [pages 48-50 of the *Blood Bowl Rulebook*](../core_rules/the_rules_of_blood_bowl.md#pass-actions))

### CATCHING THE BALL

(see Catching The Ball, [page 51 of the *Blood Bowl Rulebook*](../core_rules/the_rules_of_blood_bowl.md#catching-the-ball))

### HAND-OFF

(see Hand-Off, [page 51 of the *Blood Bowl Rulebook*](../core_rules/the_rules_of_blood_bowl.md#hand-off-1))

### THROWING THE BALL AT THE WALL**

Sometimes a player will purposefully throw the ball at a wall in order to try to have it ricochet off into a far more advantageous position.

A player that declares a Pass action may also declare that they will bounce the ball off the wall instead of passing normally. Declare which wall square the ball is being thrown at, and test for accuracy as normal. This Pass may be interfered with as normal.

If the test for accuracy is successful, the ball will ricochet from the target square. If the test is failed, roll a D6. On a 1-3 it hits the wall square to the right *of the* target square; on a 4+ it hits the wall square to the left of the target square.

The ball will then ricochet as shown in the diagrams below. It will then travel D6 squares in the direction indicated, and if not caught it will scatter once from the square where it ends up. If the ball hits another wall then it will ricochet off it. Any and all players that the ball passes over may attempt to catch the ball, in the order that the ball passes over them, counting as an inaccurate pass. Unless the ball is caught by a player on the active team, there will be a Turnover.

## Throwing other Players

One tactic that has been used with moderate success is one that seems to have been first employed in aggression, rather than as a cunning way to score. In the early days of Blood Bowl, it was i not uncommon for Big Guy players to simply launch their smaller team-mates  at troublesome opponents. Naturally, this transitioned quite well into Dungeon Bowl and, these days, it is a common tactic to see a Big Guy pitching a puny pal at an opposition player that is proving to be a particularly I prickly thorn in their side, or H even towards the opposition end zone on occasion. This isn’t without risk, though; there have been instances where a Big Guy has forgotten what's going on and eaten their ally!

### THROW TEAMMATE ACTIONS

(see Throw Teammate Actions, [pages 53-54 of the *Blood Bowl Rulebook*](../core_rules/the_rules_of_blood_bowl.md#throw-teammate-actions))

### LANDING

### LANDING IN AN OCCUPIED SQUARE

(see Landing in an Occupied Square, [page 54 of the *Blood Bowl Rulebook*](../core_rules/the_rules_of_blood_bowl.md#landing-in-an-occupied-square))

### CRASH LANDING

(see Crash Landing, [page 54 of the *Blood Bowl Rulebook*](../core_rules/the_rules_of_blood_bowl.md#crash-landing))

### HITTING THE WALL

Should the thrown player scatter into one of the dungeon walls, they risk a serious injury. The player will suffer a Crash Landing as described above. Additionally, when making the Armour roll for a player that has hit the wall apply an additional +1 modifier to the roll.


**block actions**

When a Standing player is activated,
they can immediately nominate a single Standing opposition player that
they are currently Marking and declare that they will target them with a
Slock action. Unlike other actions, there is no limit to how many
players may perform a Block action each team
turn.

If both players have the same Strength characteristic, after
modification, one block dice is rolled.

If one player has a higher Strength characteristic, after modification,
a pool of two block dice is rolled and the coach of the stronger player
selects which result to apply.

If one player has a Strength characteristic that is more than double
that of their opponent, after modification, a pool of three block dice
is rolled and the coach of the stronger player selects which result to
apply.

- player performing a Block action cannot move or after, and Prone
players cannot stand up and :rm a Block action. However, if the
target of the action is 'pushed back' into another square, the ayer
that made the action may 'follow-up' into the uare vacated, carried
forward by the momentum of attack.

**STRENGTH**

Block acbon and nominated their target, the next thing to do is Io
compare the Strength characteristic of both players, including any
Strength modifiers granted by Skills or Traits or offered by 'assists'
from team-mates (see page 48). If one player is stronger than the other,
they are more likely to knock their opponent
down:

** t its most basic, a block is a very rough H tackle. The rules of
Dungeon Bowl allow players to do almost anything to bring down an
opponent, and provided weapons aren't used, the officials rarely make
any distinction between a skilled tackle and a frenzied rain of
pummelling blows that leave a player unconscious. This is part of the
game's charm. After all, who wouldn't want to watch a violent, full
contact blood sport that happens to include some ball related
drama!**

**ASSISTING A BLOCK**

-- Slrength characteristic of the player that is performing the
Block action, or o' : i,  the Block action, can be modified by assists
offered by team-mates that are in a posh or- ti two or more players can
gang up on another. There are two types or assist '  * be
c

and 'defensive'.

**OFFENSIVE ASSISTS**

An offensive assist is when another player on the active team, a
team-mate of the player that is performing the Block action, is able to
assist. To offer an offensive assist, a player must be Marking the
opposition player that is the target of their team-mate's Block
action.

**DEFENSIVE ASSISTS**

A defensive assist is when another player on the mact team, a team-mate
of the player that is the target of a Block action, is able to assist.
To offer a defensive assist, a player must be Marking the opposition
player that is performing the Block action against their
team-mate.

A player cannot offer an offensive assist if they are being Marked by
any opposition player other than the one that is the target of their
team-mate's Block action. A player cannot offer an offensive assist if
there is a wall directly in between the player and the target of their
team-mate's Block action.

A player cannot offer a defensive assist if they are being Marked by
any opposition player other (han *the one* that is performing the Block
action against their team­mate. A player cannot offer a defensive assist
if there is a wall directly in between the player and the opposition
player performing the Block action.

Each offensive assist counted modifies the Strength characteristic of
the player performing the Block action by
+1.

Each defensive assist counted modifies the *Strength* characteristic of
the player that is the target *of the Block* action by
+1.



**T**he Push Back and POW! block dice results call for the target of a
Block action to be 'pushed back'. A pushed back player is involuntarily
moved one square away from the player performing the action. The pushed
back player is moved into a square chosen by the coach of the player
performing the action. The squares a pushed back player can be moved
into will depend upon the direction from which the block came, as shown
in the diagrams below-.

The square the pushed back player is moved into must be an unoccupied
square. If this is not possible, the pushed back player will either be
pushed into a wall (see opposite) or a chain-push will occur (see
opposite). Note that only players can occupy a square, if a square
contains only the ball, it is unoccupied and a pushed back player may
be moved into it. If a pushed back player is moved into a square that
contains the ball, the ball will bounce. A player cannot attempt to
pick up the ball when pushed back.

If there are no unoccupied squares to move aTushw" back player into,
the player is moved into a square occupied by another player, causing a
'chain-push'. When a player is chain-pushed, they are pushed back
themselves exactly as described previously. The chain- pushed player is
moved into a square chosen by the coach of the player performing the
Block action. The squares a chain-pushed player can be moved into will
depend upon the direction from which the push came, as shown in the
diagrams previously. **1**

A player can be chain-pushed even *if they are Prone or* Stunned. A
chain-push can cause a *player from either* team to be moved and may
*result in a player being* pushed into the
wall.

AMOUR AND
INJURIES

***There are many ways in which a Dungeon Bowl player can get injured.
From being brutalised by an opposition player who is hell-bent on
getting the ball, to tripping over one of the many hazards scattered
around the dungeon. Dungeon Bowl is a game that provides almost
limitless opportunity to get seriously hurt! Even death is an
ever-present threat! Most Dungeon Bowl players proudly sport impressive
scars, or teeth marks from whatever lurks within the depths of the
dungeon\...***

**RISKING INJURY**

As described on page 13, whenever one
player is Knocked Down by another, be it as the result of a B ock action
or some other, more devious trick, they become Prone and risk injury.
Likewise, whenever a player Falls Over, most often caused by failing an
Agility rest when dodging, or tripping as they Rush across the cungeon.
they become Prone and risk injury. When a P ayer is Knocked Down or
Falls Over, the coach of the opposition team will make an Armour roll
against that player.

' -cte that when a player is Placed Prone, perhaps 'a; ng wrestled
an opponent to the ground, there is no injury and no Armour roll is
made against them.

may seem that there is no way for them to re-enter the game. n fact,
in the early days of Dungeon Bowl this was the case, though it led to
various complaints and criticisms from the Magisterium that the stars of
their teams wouldn't get to shine in the
game.*

*In response to this, the Colleges of Magic pooled their resources in
order to develop the Magic Sponge - an all-purpose magical item designed
to revive those players that may have been left seeing stars (or small
birds) flying around their head!*

*/XU Dungeon Bowl teams are issued with a Magic Sponge at the start of
a game. Once per team turn, a coach may use the Magic Sponge to treat a
KO'd player in their Knocked-out box instead of teleporting a player
into the dungeon. A player treated with the Magic Sponge is immediately
moved from the Knocked-out box and into the Reserves box. The Magic
Sponge cannot be used on players that are removed as a
Casualty.*

*KICKING THEM WHILE THEY'RE
DOWN **ouling is strictly against the rules of Dungeon
Bowl, and any player tempted to stick the boot in risks the wrath of the
referees. Not that this stops anyone of course! Many teams are renowned
for being dirty and devious, and more than a few players have become
renowned in the art of the foul. Of course, the referees aren't actually
inside the dungeon (they don't have a death wish!); instead, they
utilise a series of crystals placed throughout the dungeon, allowing
them to see the action from every angle, and teleport those caught
fouling out of the dungeon.***

s mentioned previously, once per team turn, a single player on the
active team may commit a Foul action. When activated, the player
nominates a single Prone or Stunned player on the opposition team to
be the victim of the Foul. The player may move before committing the
Foul, following all of the normal movement rules, but must be in a
square adjacent to the player they wish to Foul when the action is
made. Once the Foul has been committed, they may not move further and
their activation comes to an end.

To commit a Foul, simply make an Armour (and possible Injury roll)
against the nominated victim, Offensive and defensive assists are worked
out before this Armour roll is made, exactly as when performing a Block
action, as described on page 47. Rather than modifying Strength, these
assists will modify the Armour roll:

Apply a +1 modifier to the Armour roll for each offensive assist.Apply
a -1 modifier to the Armour roll for each defensive assist.**BEING
SENT-OFF**

Regardless of the outcome, if a natural *double is rolled* (i.e., if
two 2s are *rolled before applying any modifiers)* when making either
the Armour roll or an *Injury roll* against the victim of the Foul
action, the *referee has* seen a player committing a foul on one *of the
surfaces* of the crystal balls in the referee's lounge *that cannot* be
ignored. The player committing the Foul *action is* Sent-off. They are
immediately teleported *out of the* dungeon, removed from play and must
miss the *rest* of the game. When a player is Sent-off, *a Turnover* is
caused.

**timelimits and**

**WINNING THE CAME**

Sometimes you may wish to impose a
time limit on your game. Perhaps you are playing in a tournament, during
your lunch break, or want to squeeze a game in before you sit down for
dinner.

When playing a game that has a time limit, if neither side has scored
when the time limit is reached, make sure both coaches have had an equal
number of turns. Then the team that has got the ball closer to their
opposition's End Zone, regardless of which player is holding the ball
(if any), is the winner. What this means is that players should count up
the number of squares between the square the ball is in and their
opponent's End Zone by the shortest route possible. The player that has
the lowest number of squares between the ball
and

the opposition team's End Zone is the winner. In the rare case that
this is also the same, then the game is a draw - the teams were simply
too well-matched to separate!

For Organised Play games, we would recommend a time limit of between 1
and half hours and 2 hours.

***EXAMPLE:** Jay and Rob have been playing a game of Dungeon Bowl with
a 2 hour time limit. At the end of the 2 hour time limit, neither player
has managed to score that all-important touchdown. After counting the
number of squares between the ball, which is in the hands of Rob's
Gnob/ar Lineman, and each player's End Zone, it is determined that the
ball is 23 squares away from Jay's End Zone and only 14 squares away
from Rob's End Zone. This means that Jay is the winner as the ball is
closer to Rob's End Zone - even though Rob is in possession of the
ball.*
