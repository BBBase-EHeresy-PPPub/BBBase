**ore going further, it is worth establishing some general principles
regarding some commonly used terms, dice and the game of Dungeon Bowl in
general.**

**THE COACH AND THE PLAYERS**

**ungeon Bowl** is a tabletop game and tabletop games are traditionally
played by 'players'. But Dungeon Bowl is also a game that represents a
sporting

fixture rather than a battle between rival armies. Whilst in other
tabletop games the models might represent warriors, in Dungeon Bowl the
models represent sports players. To avoid confusion, and to adhere to
the theme of the game, the rules will always refer to the models as
'players' and to you, the person rolling the dice and making the
decisions, as the 'coach'. In addition, players that belong to the same
team are referred to as 'team-mates', whilst players that do not belong
to their team are referred to as 'opposition
players'.

**TAKE-BACKS AND CHANGING ONE'S
MIND**

It is not uncommon for coaches to second-guess themselves occasionally,
saying they are about to do something before immediately changing their
mind. As a general rule, you should be tolerant of this in your
opponents, as you will likely do it yourself - after all, we are playing
a game and games should be fun and enjoyable for all! However, once dice
have been rolled for any reason, you must abide by
your

I decision; you can no longer go back and change anything that came
before the dice roll!

**R[ANDOMLY **[selecting a
player]]

the rules will often require a coach to select a player at random. To
do this, simply roll a D16 and check the team Draft list, which will
have your players numbered from ■ to 16. The number rolled is the
player selected. If the

^n^ber rolled doesn't correspond to a player or, as can be the case,
if the number rolled doesn't meet the criteria of the । - ayer to be
randomly selected (perhaps the number rolled corresponds to a player
not in the dungeon, for example) simply re-roll the
dice.

**THE TURNOVER**

**O**ne of the most important mechanics of the game of Dungeon Bowl is
the 'Turnover'. Many unfortunate events will cause the active team's
turn to end prematurely with a Turnover, regardless of how many players
have been activated.

A Turnover is caused:]

-   
-   
-   
-   
-   
-   
-   
-   
-   

[If a player on the active team Falls Over during their own
activation.If a player on the active team is Knocked Down during their
team turn.If a player on the active team that is in possession of the
ball is Placed Prone during their team turn.If a player on the active
team attempts to pick up the ball from the ground and fails, even if the
bouncing ball is then caught by a player from the active team.If a
player on the active team fumbles a Pass action, even if the bouncing
ball is then caught by a player from the active team.If no player on the
active team catches the ball after a Pass action or a Hand-off action
and the ball comes to rest on the ground or in the possession of a
player from the opposition team.If a Pass action is Deflected or
Intercepted and the ball comes to rest either on the ground or in the
possession of a player from the opposition team.If a player on the
active team that is in possession of the ball is thrown by a team-mate
and either fails to land safely, or is eaten, even if the bouncing ball
is then caught by a player from the active team.If a player on the
active team is Sent-off by the referee for committing a Foul.This list
is not exhaustive; there may be other events that will cause a Turnover.
Where this is the case, these will be detailed by the
rules.

Should a Turnover occur, any dice rolls that must be made as a result
of the event that caused it are made immediately, after which the
current player's activation ends. The active team may not activate any
more players and the current team turn
ends.

*For example, should one of your players Fall Over whilst moving, an
Armour roll is made against them. If that player was in possession of
the ball, the ball will then bounce. Once the ball has come to rest, the
player's activation ends and you may activate no more players this
turn. Finally, your team turn ends and the opposition team becomes the
active team.*\


**DICE ROLLING**

T][he game *of* Dungeon *Bowl* uses
*dice rolls a great deal.* The *roll of a dice determines everything,*
be *it a simple attempt to pick up he ball, which portal a player
teleports to, or the* c - ■ -ness *of a* particularly sneaky
foul.

**SINGLE DICE ROLL**

The rules will often require you to roil a single dice, in which case
the rules will say 'roll a D6', or 'roll a D8', for
example.

**MULTIPLE DICE ROLLS**

Often the rules will state 'roll 2D6'. In such cases, two D6 are rolled
and the results added together to give a total between 2 and 12. This is
a multiple dice roll.

**DICE POOLS**

Sometimes the game may require two or more dice be rolled and a single
result selected - for example, a coach might roll two or three block
dice and select one result to apply. In this case a 'pool' of dice has
been rolled.

**TARGET NUMBER ROLLS**

Often, when making a single dice roll or a multiple dice roll, the
rules will require you to roll a specific number followed by a '+'.
This indicates that the roll is a 'target number roll'. Making a
target number roll is simple. If you are required to roll a 4+ on a
single D6, for example, a roll of 4, 5 or 6 would be a success, but a
roll of 1, 2 or 3 would not be.

**MODIFYING DICE ROLLS**

The rules will often call for a dice roll to be modified,
particularly when making a target number roll. To do this, simply roll
the dice and then add or subtract the modifiers) shown, effectively
changing the outcome of the dice roll. If the rules ever instruct you
to divide a dice roll in any way, any fractions should be rounded up,
unless the rules state otherwise.

**ROLLING] OFF**

.nay vail ror 00th coaches to roll a dice (usually either a D6 or a
D3). Often a characteristic of some sort will be added to the result.
This is called 'rolling off and the highest score always wins a
roll-off. In the case of a tie, roll again unless otherwise
instructed.

**NATURAL ROLLS \"**

A 'natural' roll is the actual number rolled on a dice, regardless of
modifiers. It is not uncommon for a test to be passed if a natural 6
is rolled or failed if a natural 1 is rolled, even if modifiers might
seemingly make success a certainty or failure seem
impossible.

**re-rolls**

W][hen rolling dice, it is common for
filing wrong! Fortunately, Dungeon Bowl allows\^^0^ certain dice rolls
to be re-rolled:]

-   
-   

[The second result must always be accepted wen if it is worse than the
original result.A dice can never be re-rolled more than one regardless
of the source of the re-roll.***SKILL
RE-ROLLS***

Many players possess Skills that allow them to re-roll dice in a
specific situation:]

-   
-   
-   
-   

[Skill re-rolls can only be used as detailed in the Skill's
description.Skill re-rolls can be used during either team's turn, as
appropriate.When a dice pool is rolled, a Skill *re-roll will allow*
only certain results to be re-rolled, as detailed in the Skill's
description.If a Skill re-roll is used to re-roll some, but not all,
dice from a dice pool, then a team re-roll cannot be used to re-roll the
rest.**TEAM RE-ROLLS**

Every Dungeon Bowl team will have a number of team re-rolls to use
during a game. A team will start each game with its full complement of
team re-rolls.]

-   

[Team re-rolls can only be used when a team is active, during its own
team turn.Team re-rolls cannot be used to
re-roll:

Deviation, scatter and bounce rolls.

Or:

Armour, Injury and Casualty rolls.

When a dice pool is rolled, a team re-roll can be used- hen a team
re-roll is used, all of the dice in the
dice

Pool must be re-rolled (not just those dice that show an undesirable
result)

A team can use as many team re-rolls as they wish in earn turn, so
long as they have enough remaining­emember, though, you can never
re-roll a re-roll-

**DE ATE, SCATTER OR BOUNCE**

T][footballs used in Dungeon Bowl are
oddly shaped and can often behave quite erratically,- specially when
they hit a flat surface. Throughout the i . reference will be made to
the ball 'deviating', 'scaT or 'bouncing', and it is worth
establishing

early ' hat is meant by each of these
terms:

**DEVI**

This represents a desperate pass veering wildly
off-target:

When the ball deviates, it moves a number of squares equal to the
roll of a D6 from the square in which it was placed, in a direction
determined by rolling a D8 and referring to the Random Direction
template.

• If the ball lands in a square that is occupied by a Standing player
that has not lost their Tackle Zone (see page 12), that player must
attempt to catch the ball (see page 43). If they fail, it will bounce
as described opposite.]

-   

[If the ball lands in an unoccupied square or a square that is occupied
either by a Standing player that has lost their Tackle Zone or by a
Prone or Stunned player, it will bounce before it comes to rest on the
ground.**SCATTER**

i his happens whenever a ball (or a thrown player) in the air travels
in an unexpected way:

When the ball scatters, it moves from the square in which it was
placed three times before landing, each time moving one square in a
direction determined by rolling a D8 and referring to the Random
Direction template.]

-   
-   

[A player cannot attempt to catch the ball should it enter the square
they occupy on the first or second scatter roll, as it is still high
in the air at this point.h after the third scatter roll the ball lands
in a square that is occupied by a Standing player that has not lost
their Tackle Zone, that player must attempt to catch the ball. If they
fail, it will bounce.If after the third scatter roll the ball lands in
an unoccupied square or a square that is occupied by either a Standing
player that has lost their Tackle Zone ^Or^ by a Prone or Stunned
player, it will bounce before 't comes to rest on the
ground.

![](../media/dungeon_bowl/image31.jpg)

**BOUNCE**

This happens for many reasons, most often when the ball (or the player
in possession of it!) hits the ground or when a player drops
it:]

-   
-   
-   

[When the ball bounces, it moves one square in a direction determined by
rolling a D8 and referring - the Random Direction template.If the ball
bounces into a square that is occupied by a Standing player that has not
lost their Tackle Zone, that player must attempt to catch the ball. If
they fail, it will bounce again.If the ball bounces into a square that
is occupied either by a Standing player that has lost their Tackle Zone
or by a Prone or Stunned player, the ball will continue to bounce until
it is caught by a Standing player or it comes to rest in an unoccupied
square.**BOUNCING OFF THE WALL**

Sometimes the ball will hit the walls of the dungeon, causing it to
veer off in a random direction. This could be due to the ball bouncing
into the wall, a player fumbling the ball next to the wall, or various
other reasons.

When the ball would hit the wall of the dungeon following a bounce,
scatter or deviation, place the Ricochet template so that the Blood Bowl
logo is theoretically where the ball would be if it hadn't hit the
wall, and then roll a D6. The ball will be placed in the square
corresponding to the roll, as determined by the Ricochet
template.

If the ball would bounce into a corner, then it will bounce as shown in
one of the diagrams below, depending on which is most
appropriate.

![](../media/dungeon_bowl/image32.jpg)

Sometimes players may try to use the *walls to their* advantage,
throwing the ball in such a way as to bounce it off the side of the
dungeon into a more advantageous position. This works slightly
differently and is *described fully* on page
*43.*

time.

A ~P~\| ~iy~er that has lost their Tackle Zone for any reason cannot
Mark an opposition player, though they can be Marked
themselves.

Players never Mark team-mates - they will only Mark opposition players.
Marking opposition players, and being Marked by them in turn, has
multiple in-game effects.

**THE TACKLE ZONE**

A Standing player exerts control over the squares around them. This is
called their 'Tackle Zone' and covers all of the eight squares adjacent
to a Standing player, as shown m the
diagram.

![](../media/dungeon_bowl/image34.jpg)

\


**OPEN PLAYERS**

A player that is not being Marked, i.e., a player that is not within
the Tackle Zone of any opposition players (as described previously), is
said to be 'Open'. Open players can move freely and perform actions
more easily, free

from the interference of opposition
players.

**STUNNED**

When a player is Stunned, the model is laid lace down on the dungeon. A
Stunned player is not. eligible to be activated during their team turn.
When a team's turn ends, even if it ends with a Turnover, any players
that were Stunned when the turn began will automatically roll over and
become Prone. If a player became Stunned during the course of their own
team turn, they must remain Stunned until the end of their team's next
turn, when they will automatically roll over and become
Prone.

Players are often 'Knocked Down' as the result of a vicious Block
action from an opposition player or when they attempt to perform a Block
action against an opposition player who proves to be bigger, tougher or
luckier than they are. Players can also be Knocked Down by other
external factors (such as explosions or spells), or by a special rule or
by a Skill used by an opposition player:]

higher number is better.**MOV ALLI** This ( of sqi. when turn, player to

**CHARACTERISTIC MODIFIERS**

**W**hen making a test against any of a player's characteristics,
there are a number of modifiers that may apply, some making success
harder, some making it easier. Where modifiers apply to a Characteristic
test, the rules will list and detail
them:

player can perform that allow them to move, ranging from a simple Move
action to a dramatic Blitz (actions are dealt with in detail on page
35).

**STRENGTH (ST)**

A player's Strength characteristic represents how physically strong
they are. Strength is used during Block actions, both when performing
them and when defending against them.

**AGILITY (AG)**

A player's Agility characteristic represents their Skill and
dexterity in different situations, be it how easily they can pick up
the ball or their ability to break away from a
scrum.

\


***ARMOUR VALUE (AV) \~***

A player's Armour Value is a hard­working characteristic. Most simply,
it represents how the quality and durability of a player's sports kit
protects them from harm. But AV can also represent how tough a player
is. Some players may appear lightly armoured but have a high AV
characteristic, indicating a high degree of physical
durability.

\


**SKILLS&TRAITS**

In addition to their characteristics, a player may possess one or more
Skills or Traits.

**SKILLS**

Skills improve a player's performance in key areas, be it granting them
a free re-roll in specific situations, or allowing them to modify a dice
roll.

Some players begin their career with

![](../media/dungeon_bowl/image38.jpg)

***AGILITY TESTS***

You will often be required to test against a player's Agility. An
Agility test is a target number roll made on a single D6, as described
on page 10. In addition, if the roll is a natural 6, the test is
automatically passed. However, if the roll is a natural 1, the test is
automatically failed.

Others may appear very heavily armoured yet have a low AV
characteristic, showing that in spite of their kit, they are delicate
and prone to injury!

***ARMOUR ROLLS***

Whenever a test is required against a player's Armour Value, it is the
coach of the opposition team that makes it. This is referred to as an
'Armour roll'. An Armour roll is a target number roll made on 2D6. If
the roll is successful, the player's armour is 'broken'. If the roll is
unsuccessful, the player's armour is not broken and protects them from
harm.

\


natural talents that are represented in this way - others develop new
Skills as they improve during the course of a college
league.

***TRAITS***

Whilst a player can learn Skills during a college league, Traits
represent a unique ability a player brings to the game. Traits can be
both positive and negative. Whatever the case, it is most unusual for a
player to develop a new Trait during a league (though not impossible);
players possess Traits when hired and retain them over their entire
career.

**TEAM ROSTERS**

\


**TEAMDRAFTLISTS**

hen you draft your team, you will also need to complete a 'Team Draft
list. This contains spaces in which to record each player permanently
hired to your team, their name, position, Hi~r~j~n~g p~ee\ an~d player
profile, along with spaces to record experience gained in the form of
'Star Player Points' (see page 58) and advancements earned during
league play. The 'Current Value' of each player is recorded, which is
equal to their Hiring Fee plus the 'Value Increase' of any advancements
they gain over the course of a league (see page
60).

There is also space to list other important team details, such as the
number of team re-rolls bought, as well as the College of Magic the team
represents, team name

and the name of the coach.

![](../media/dungeon_bowl/image40.png)

D][ungeon Bowl is played between the
eight Colleges of Magic, and each of the colleges are made up of
different races and player types that have pledged themselves to their
college. Each College of Magic has its own unique team roster used to
create their team, which includes the player types they can hire, each
player's profile, and their Hiring Fee. These can be found on pages
88-103.

\


Finally, the Team Draft list contains spaces to record how many gold
pieces the team has in its Treasury (see page 20) and the total value of
the team when all of the players, team re-rolls and player advances are
accounted for.

***GAME RECORD SHEET***

The reverse of the Team Draft list features the
Game

Record sheet. This is used to keep track of any
league

fixtures and friendlies played over the course of a league, including
details of opposition teams, the names of their coaches, along with any
petty cash awarded, Inducements hired (see page 76), Current Team Value
and any other notes coaches wish to
keep.

Once the game is over, this is also where the outcome ecorded along

earn Draft Budget is the amount of gold

is (GP) you have to spend on your fledgling Dungeon Bowl
team-.

When drafting your team for league play, you have a budget of 1,000,000
gold pieces to spend on players, team re-rolls and so
forth.

When drafting a team for exhibition play, you may have a higher budget
(see page 85).

**HIRING PLAYERS** Players are the only compulsory
element on any Dungeon Bowl team. Each team roster details all of the
players available to a team of that type and their Hiring Fee. When
drafting a team, you should select the players you want to permanently
hire for your team, pay their Hiring Fee from your Team Draft Budget and
make a record of the player on the Team Draft
list.

Each college team roster is divided up into sections, based on the
positions of the players. Each section will contain a list of player
types that can play for that college, and will also state how many
players in tota a team can select from this section of the roster, in
any combination. For example, a College of Shadow team can have 0-2
players from their Blitzer section. This means they could have two
Skaven Blitzers and no Dark Blitzers; two Dark Elf Blitzers and no
Skaven Blitzers;

or one of each.

The first and most important thing to be aware o w drafting a Dungeon
Bowl team is the minimum an maximum number of players
permitted:

• Every Dungeon Bowl team must contain a [h^1101^\^] of
eleven (11) permanently hired players when i first drafted.
.

\* No Dungeon Bowl team can ever contain more sixteen (16)
permanently hired players.

'f is important to note that, during the course of a 'Wie season,
the number of players a team can ^rn^\*y fall below 11 due to injury
and death. This is. Permitted (jf not ideal!) and is covered in more e
fhe Take on Journeymen section on page

**PLAYER POSITIONS**

There are distinctions to be made between the players within a team,
separating them by their role within the ; game, from the humble Lineman
to the more specialised roles performed by the 'positional'
players.

*LINEMEN:* The backbone of any team:

All colleges will have a player type, sometimes more than one, that
they are permitted to take 0-12 or 0-16 of. Regardless of name (for
many races call their Linemen by another name), this Player type is
the team's 'Lineman' positional.

***BLITZERS:*** On offence, Blitzers force gaps through the opposition,
or ram them into the walls of the dungeon. In defence, they will
violently target key opposition players.

***THROWERS:*** It is often the Thrower that takes the role of capiain
Alling the plays, making split second demons, and attempting to locate
the ball in the various chests.

***CATCHERS*** The safe pair of hands or, any\^

**PUR® IN G1AMR\|\^**

Any team can purchase team re-rolls. These represen time spent training
and the team's ability to read in a split second to mistakes to turn
their fortunes around. The cost reflects the time and effort college
teams must invest to achieve this level of
training:]

-   
-   

[Every college may purchase 0-8 team re-rolls when it is first
drafted, for the cost of 50,000 gold pieces each, paid for from the
Team Draft Budget.During the course of a league, additional team
re-rolls may be purchased at a later date, in the Hiring, Firing and
Temporarily Retiring step of the post-game sequence (see page 60), but
the team must pay double. For example, if a team wishes to purchase
team re-rolls during the course of the league, it will cost them
100,000 gold pieces rather than the usual 50,000.When calculating Team
Value (see as follows), team re-rolls add only the cost of 50,000 gold
pieces, even if they are purchased at double the cost later on' in a
league.

**HE[R INFORMATION] 2**

As mentioned previously, the Team Draft list contair spaces to record
several other important details. Th includes the team Treasury, the size
of their fan fo : • ng, and the cash value of the team as a
whole.

**TREASURY**

Any gold pieces not spent when drafting the team are recorded in the
Treasury section of the Team Draft list. Over the course of a league
season, winnings are added to this. The Treasury is used to purchase
Inducements (see page 76) as well as new additions to the team, such as
new players.
