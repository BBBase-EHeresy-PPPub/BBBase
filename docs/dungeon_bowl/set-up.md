to set up the dungeon-a rather ,mpo

Whenever two Dungeon tiles are placed adjacent to each other, there
should always be at least two squares connecting them. No Dungeon tiles
should ever be connected by a single square - this simply wouldn't give
enough room for the players to move through! Additionally, wherever two
Dungeon tiles join together, place a Door token between them to show the
doorway that connects the two tiles. These are always two squares wide,
and should be placed as centrally as possible. It should also be noted
that the doorways are always assumed to have the doors removed, and so
are simply openings - the Magisterium thought traversing the dungeon
would be difficult enough without having to constantly open and close
doors!

![](../media/dungeon_bowl/image52.jpg)When both players are
bar

is laid out, the two End Zones w should be placed as fat away from
1\ 1 -

within the dungeon.

After the dungeon has been laid out, the Chests and Portals need to be
deployed.

The Chests are always deployed first. Both coaches roll a single D6,
re-rolling any ties, with the coach who rolls highest deploying the
first Chest and alternating from there. Make sure players don't look
inside the Chests, that way it is entirely unknown which Chest contains
the ball. Chests may be deployed in any square, with the following
exceptions:

Chests may not be deployed in either End Zone, or in a dungeon tile
connected to an End Zone.

Only a single Chest may be deployed in each Dungeon
tile.

After the Chests have been deployed, the POrta(s need to be placed
within the dungeon. Each Jrtal (s numbered differently, between 1
and 6, and idbe deployed in order. Starting with the coach wh
rolled lowest in the previous roll-off, players alterne ; deploys the
Portals following the same restrictions as the Chest? Additionally,
Portals may not be deployed within 2 squares of a
Chest.

After the dungeon has been laid out, coaches toss a coin. The winner
chooses which of the two End Zones is theirs. With the dungeon deployed
between them, coaches place their dugout beside their End
Zone.

Both coaches then place their teams in the dungeon and their re-roll
markers onto their dugout before quickly explaining the details of their
team for their opponent's benefit.

Below are some examples of ways you could choose to lay out the
dungeon. You can choose to use one of the layouts given here, or create
your own using the rules on the previous
page.

[**DUNGEON TILE SPECIAL
RULES**

F][rom pitfalls and chasms to ancient
crypts, and even the chance of some wanderincreatur the Wizards of
the Old World maintain are filled with all kinds of perils and dangers.
Quite wh  shall we say, interesting dungeons has never really

within them! n Pices

Some of the Dungeon tiles, specifically the small rooms and the large
rooms, have sopcial mhc

H\ u associated them, adding to the unpredictability that Dungeon
Bowl is known for. 1

![](../media/dungeon_bowl/image54.jpg)*Though there is little need for many
weapons in the Old World, mainly as differences are settled with a
good game of Blood Bowl, many dungeons will still contain some form of
armoury filled with dust-covered weapons. Should a player trip and
fall, there is every chance of landing upon a blade that still has a
keen edge, which could do some serious
damage!*

Whenever an Armour roll is made for a player within the *Armoury,* an
additional +1 modifier is added to the
roll.

 THEBONEpTt 

*Dungeons can be dangerous places and, in years gone by, many will

*Thngeons used for games between collegi ground, and this
can lead to rooms becoming flooded after a heavy ' rainfall. Though
this makes it far harder for players to traverse the dungeon, it
certainly isn't enough to stop a game going ahead; players are simply
told to watch their step!*

Whilst within the Flooded Room, players that attempt to Rush will Fall
Over on the roll of a 1 or a 2 rather than just a
1.

![](../media/dungeon_bowl/image55.jpg)***THE FORGOTTEN
JAIL***

*The dungeons of the Old World aren't just used for games between the
colleges; they are still sometimes used for their more traditional
purpose when the usual prisons are full. Then again, as they are so
rarely used, those jailed within are often forgotten and left to rot -
a sight that can cause players to stop to look with morbid fascination
rather than focusing on the game.*

Any player that begins their turn within the Forgotten Jail must roll
a D6. On a 1 or 2, the player reduces their MA by 2 until the end of
their activation.

![](../media/dungeon_bowl/image56.jpg)![](../media/dungeon_bowl/image57.jpg)![](../media/dungeon_bowl/image58.png)***THE

*Every dungeon needs a kitchen; after all, the Players\ an

![](../media/dungeon_bowl/image59.jpg)**THE
SEWER**

*Sewers are not the nicest of places within a dungeon-, all
thewastea blood has to go somewhere, after all! This makes the sewer
a rather disgusting mom for players to traverse, and wading through
the contents of the sewer certainly makes those unfortunate enough to
enter it an unpleasant opponent to be
around!*

Players that enter the Sewer gain the Disturbing Presence trait until
the start of their next activation.

**THE TREASURE-ROOM**

*The Magisterium of the colleges will often store their vast wealth
within one of the rooms of the dungeon for safekeeping. It is not
unheard of for ungeon Bowl players to 'accidentally' stumble across
these treasure* ooms *mid-game and gather their college an extra bonus
whilst they are there if they can.*

A player that begins their activation within the Treasure Room may
perform the Gather Funds special action instead of doing anything else
for that turn:

***GATHER FUNDS:***

*make a note* Performed this action e\ end f\ the %ame

**thHhaotjcidol**

*fitosoirieof the gods are often collected by the Magisterlum and
coaches, and placed throughout their dungeons to gain the blessings of
heir patron. Some of these are simply an idol, though some
(particularly ones to the Dark Gods) are believed to actually hold some
form of power. Some players claim that, mid-game, these idols actually
seem to bestow*

*some of this power upon those nearby.*

The Chaotic Idol is a 2 square by 2 square impassable feature in this
room that is treated as a wall. Additionally, if a player begins their
activation within this room, roll a D6. On the roll of a 6, the player
increases their ST by 1 for the duration of their
activation.

[the crypt]

*When a well thought after member of a college, such as a Magister or
'avoured patron, passes on, they sometimes request to be buried
within* the *dungeon so they can continue being close to the sport
they loved, -men, enchantments are put upon their crypts to prevent
any Ught- mgered players from trying to break into their
coffin.*

Crypt has two 1 square by 2 square impassable features in this 'at
are treated as a wall, though they do not block Line of
Sight.

![](../media/dungeon_bowl/image60.jpg)![](../media/dungeon_bowl/image61.jpg)Add tionally, if a player would be
pushed into a Crypt then they are Knocked " 'A a id any Armour
roll made against them will have a +1 modifier.\

![](../media/dungeon_bowl/image62.png)**THE
DONYOUNGL**

*Many creatures are kept by the colleges for their studies, as mascots
for their Dungeon Bowl teams. They are often housed within the dungeon,
and it is not always wise to disturb them mid-game! A partly favourite
creature of many teams are Dragon younglings - and those who stumble
upon their lair are likely to feel the fiery wrath of the
Dragon*

The Dragon Youngling is a 2 square by 2 square impassable feature in
this room that is treated as a wall, though it does not block Line of
Sight. Additionally, any player that begins their activation within the
Dragon Youngling's Lair must roll a D6. On a 5+ that player is
immediately Knocked Down. This will only cause a Turnover if the player
was holding the ball.

*To add an extra bit of spice to the game, and to appease the
co/iege's sponsors, some Wizards like to feature a flaming chasm
running across one of the rooms that is only crossable by a lone rope
bridge. Not only is this a rather spectacular sight, but it is also
potentially deadly to those that fall into
it.*

The Fiery Chasm is a 1 square by 4 square impassable feature in this
room, though it does not block Line of Sight. It also has a *rope
bridge* across it that takes up a single square; this can be crossed as
normal.

Any player that is pushed into the Fiery Chasm automatically suffers
*a* Casualty result; roll on the Casualty table for them. Additionally,
should the ball land in one of the squares of the Fiery Chasm, scatter
it another square that it is no longer in the Fiery
Chasm.

**DEPLOYMENT**

The six Chests are deployed around the dungeon as described on page 24.
One of these will contain the football, whilst the other five will
contain an explosive magical spell.

**OPENING CHESTS**

**ack** *when the game of Dungeon Bowl was first invented, the
Magisterium realised that they would need to tweak some of the more
traditional rules of Blood Bowl to suit the more unique setting of the
dungeon and to add that extra bit of excitement to the game. One of*
these changes was to *remove the usual kick-off; it wouldn't really work
with* the *low ceilings in many rooms of the
dungeon.*

*Instead, a number of identical chests are placed around the dungeon*
that the *players will need to locate. One of these chests will include
the all- important football; however, the others are fitted with a
spectacular, though (usually) non-lethal, magical spell that will
explode in the face of whoever* should *open
it!*

Players may not move over a Chest, it is essentially an impassible
feature that does not block Line of Sight. A player that finishes a Move
action (but not as part of a Blitz action) in a square adjacent to a
Chest, and who is not Marked 'when they finish their Move action, may
choose to open the Chest. When a Player opens a Chest, remove the lid of
the model to see what is inside.

'f the Chest contains the football, then the player immediately gains
Possession of the ball and their activation ends immediately. The Chest
is - removed from play and the square it was in becomes a normal
square.

Remember that if a player is teleported more fa, once in an activation,

Teleportation spells are not *perfect, and can be* temperamental at
