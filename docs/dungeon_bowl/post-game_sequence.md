Players can gain Skills from their Primary skill categories easily,
whilst gaining Skills from their Secondary skill categories is more
costly in terms of SPP

**R**ather than spend SPP on a new Skill, a player may spend SPP to
improve a characteristic. To do so, simply reduce the player's SPP by
the amount shown on the Advancements table, roll a DI6 on the table
below and record the player's improved characteristic on your Team
Draft list:

Passing Ability, however, the characteristic is lowered by 1. For

When a player Temporarily Retires (TR), make a note in the appropriate
box on your Team Draft List. They remain as part of your team and are
not deleted from your Team Draft List. They cannot take part in any
further games this season but they will still count towards both the
maximum number of players of their type allowed by the team roster, and
the 16 player maximum. Finally, whilst their Current Value is counted
when workingout Team Value, it is not counted when working out Current
Team Value.
