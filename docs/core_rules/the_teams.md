## The Teams

From diminutive Halflinngs to huge hulking ogres, from elegant and graceful Elves to lumbering and brutal orcs - Blood Bowl players come in all shapes and sizes. These players represent a great many races and nations from all over the known world, which form up into an even greater number of teams of differrent types. From fresh-faced rookie squads, to famous franchises established decades ago, the number of teams playing the game today is higher than at any time in history. Teams travel far and wide searching for fame and glory. Some will make it. Most will be forgotten, a footnote on the sports trivia encyclopaedias of history.

#### BLOOD BOWL TEAMS

This section contains the rosters used to draft a rookie Blood Bowl team of your own for use in league play. It explains the special rules of different types that all teams have, detailing the advantages and disadvantages these bring to a team. Finally, it also briefly explains ‘tiers’, a method used to give an idea of the relative strengths and weaknesses of rookie Blood Bowl teams.

#### SPECIAL RULES

Most Blood Bowl teams are, despite appearances, quite straightforward in their behaviour and approach to the great game. Others are not. Be they the reanimated dead, devotees of the Dark Gods or corrupt Greenskins, many teams differ somewhat from the norm. 

Special rules to help represent the different nuances of races and teams fall into two categories: the first, 'Regional' special rules, are named after famous leagues or competitions, and these are attached to teams that traditionally play in those leagues. Their purpose is to make it easy to determine which Inducements a team can or cannot take, thus simplifying the almost impenetrably complicated rules and regulations of the NAF.

The second category, 'Team' special rules, contains more complex rules. These deal with a unique characteristic of the team, something that sets it apart from others. These special rules grant the team certain benefitts not enjoyed by other teams.

### REGIONAL SPECIAL RULES

As noted in their description, some Inducements are available only to teams with one of the following special rules. Other Inducements may be available for a reduced rate to teams with one of the following special rules.

All teams have one or more of the following special rules: 

**BADLANDS BRAWL**
*The Badlands Brawl is home to a great many Greenskin and Ogreteams. Unsurprisingly, Blood Bowl in the Badlands is a brutal,violent and extremely dishonest affair, but these are virtues thatmake it ever popular with the fans!*

**ELVEN KINGD0MS LEAGUE**
*One of the oldest leagues in the known world, the Elven KingdomsLeague prides itself on upholding the traditions of classically-correct Blood Bowl. Many find it dull but, in terms of elegance andexpertise, it is second to none.*

**HALFLING THIMBLE CUP**
*Traditionally, Halflinngs have been associated more closely with theculinary arts than the world of professional sport. In recent yearsthis has changed greatly, and the Thimble Cup has become amainstay on the Blood Bowl calendar.*

**LUSTRIAN SUPERLEAGUE**
*The Lustrian Superleague is the oldest competition in theworld, and home to many of the sport's most ancient teams.For millennia it was closed to all except Lizardmen teams, but inrecent years has opened its ranks to welcome other races.*

**OLD WORLD CLASSIC**
*Since the collapse of the NAF, Blood Bowl in the Old World hasstruggled. But in recent years the sport's fortunes have improved,largely thanks to the founding of the Old World Classic, acompetition that draws together many minor leagues.* 

**SYLVANIAN SPOTLIGHT**
*For many decades the Sylvanian Spotlight was the only placemost Undead teams could hope to compete. In recent years, thedevelopment of sun protection magic has changed this, allowingthe athletically inclined Undead to play at anytime, anywhere!*

**UNDERWORLD CHALLENGE**
*A secretive league that, until only recently, many pundits refusedto believe even existed! The Underworld Challenge hosts manystrange and diverse teams, the likes of which are rarely seen indaylight. For a horrifying spectacle, it is second to none!* 

**WORLDS EDGE SUPERLEAGUE**
*Played on high peaks under clear skies, the Superleague is thepride of the Dwarfen realm. Games last many hours as rules arecarefully checked and checked again, ensuring that the purity ofRoze-El's sacred work is maintained. Interestingly, in Dwarfish'venerable' and 'dull' are spelled the same.*


### Team Special Rules

Some teams may have one or more of the following special rules. These detail unique characteristics that set the team apart from others, be it the ability to reanimate the dead or the blessings of a patron Chaos deity.

Some teams may have one or more of the following special rules:

#### BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION
*Many teams are legendarily unscrupulous. Such teamsexcel in violence and dirty play. What's more, they'renot afraid to exert their influencce on officials, either byextortion or blackmail, encouraging them to turn a blindeye to even the most illegal of illegal procedures!*

It takes a strong-willed referee indeed to risk making an enemy of a team so renowned for reacting.. poorly towards any officiall that would rebuke its behaviour:

* Once per game, when rolling on the Argue the Call table, you may re-roll a roll of a natural 1.

In addition, a team with this special rule can purchase certain Inducements for a reduced price, as noted in the description of that Inducement.

#### FAVOURED OF..
*The followers of the Ruinous Powers are drawn to BloodBowl, paying homage to their dark gods through violenceon the pitch. Whilst many teams worship Chaos as apantheon, many more dedicate their souls entirely to asingle patron deity.*

Certain Inducements are only available to teams that are 'Favoured of' a specificc Chaos power, as noted in their description. A team may be noted as being either: Favoured of Chaos Undivided, Favoured of Khorne, Favoured of Nurgle, Favoured of Tzeentch or Favoured of Slaanesh. In some cases, however, you may be able to choose the team's alignment when the team is first drafted, as in the case of Chaos Renegades.

A team with this special rule cannot change its alignment.

#### LOW COST LINEMEN
*Some teams field Linemen of great skill and ability. Otherteams do not and will happily take on the most uselessof players to fill out their ranks. Readily available, easilyreplaceable and usually willing to work for pennies, suchplayers fill gaps in the rosters, but rarely do much more!*

Teams with this special rule are not very particular about the Linemen they hire. To make up for this, they don't usually bother to pay them:

* In league play (but not in exhibition play), when calculating the   Current Value of any permanently hired

Lineman players on a team with this special rule, the Hiring Fee of that player is not included.

#### MASTERS OF UNDEATH
*Teams with this special rule all fall into the broadercategory of 'Undead'. Usually created from the animatedcorpses of freshly-deceased players brought backto the game by athletically-inclined necromancers,such teams don't always operate quite like their morevital counterparts!*

The Head Coach of this team is replaced by a Necromancer. Once per game, they can 'Raise the Dead': 
* If a player on the opposing team with a Strength characteristic of 4 or less and that does not have the Regeneration or Stunty traits suffers a Casualty result of 15-16, DEAD, and if they cannot be saved by an apothecary, a new rookie Zombie Lineman player can be placed immediately in the Reserves box of this team's dugout. Note that this may cause the team to have more than 16 players for the remainder of the game.

* During Step 4 of the post-game sequence, this player may be permanently hired for free if the team has fewer than 16 players on its Team Draft list, otherwise it will be lost. The player's full value still counts towards the Team Value.

Additionally, just like the Head Coach of any other team, a Necromancer can Argue the Call when one of their players is Sent-off for committing a Foul, as long as they haven't been sent off themselves.

### Team Tiers

Not all teams are created equal. Some rookie teams are more challenging to coach than others, either because of the way in which players and their different skills interact, or because background-wise they would struggle to win (after all, what chance would a Halflinng team really have against a Dark Elf team?).

This is entirely intentional, and over the years a great many experienced coaches have savoured the challenge of playing to win with the teams that might be considered quite unlikely to be victorious!

All teams belong to one of three tiers, as detailed on their Team roster:

* Tier 1 is occupied by the strongest and most forgiving of teams, those that can easily recover from mistakes and mishaps.
* Tier 2 consists of those teams that often require a bit more experience on the part of the coach to excel. They are all highly competitive teams, but often a small mistake can prove costly!
* Tier 3, otherwise known as the 'Stunty teams', is home to the most difficult of teams to master. Halflinng, Goblins and more, such teams are often victim to a hard time from bigger, tougher players, but they can still perform well in the hands of an experienced coach. To anyone who wants a real challenge but a truly entertaining game, Stunty teams are it!
