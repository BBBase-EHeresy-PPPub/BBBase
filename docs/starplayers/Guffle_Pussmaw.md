Once per game, if Guffle is marking an opposing player who catches the ball, he may immediately make an unmodified Armour roll, and subsequent Injury roll if necessary, against that player.

If the target's Armour is broken, Guffle immediately gains possession of the ball. No Turnover is caused as a result of using this special rule.
