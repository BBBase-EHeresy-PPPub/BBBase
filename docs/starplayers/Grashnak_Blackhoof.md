Once per game, when Grashnak performs a Blitz action, Grashnak may roll one additional Block dice against the opposition player, regardless of the opposition player's Strength, to a maximum of three Block dice. If Grashnak performs a second Block action due to the Frenzy skill, this second Block action will also benefit from this rule.
