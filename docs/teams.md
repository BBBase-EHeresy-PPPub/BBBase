**BLACK ORC TEAMS**
N0TABLE EXAMPLES: THE THUNDER VALLEY GREENSKINS, THE 0RCLAND RAIDERS,

Black Orcs are the biggest and strongest of all Orcs. Many believe
they draw their name from their dark green skin, although the title is
more likely derived from their dour demeanour and bleak sense of
humour! Grim and singularly focused on violence, it's no wonder so
many flocck to the Blood Bowl pitch! Black Orcs treat other Greenskins
as little more than frivolous amateurs, largely because lesser Orcs
are likely to squabble amongst themselves and focus too much on
beating up the opposition, instead of concentrating on the game.
Consequently, many Black Orcs refuse to play
![](media/core_rules/image340.jpg)alongside other Orcs, choosing instead
to form their own teams. Yet Black Orcs aren't stupid - they know the
importance of speed and agility. As a result, Black Orc teams make
great use of Goblins, many of whom they become quite fond of, treating
them as favourite pets and training them to be tough with regular
clumps about the noggin!

Blood Bowl is arguably even more popular among the followers of the
Chaos gods than it is among civilised folk. Maybe it's the cult-like
supporters' clubs, the constant violence both on and off the pitch, or
just the brightly-coloured strips Whatever the case, wherever you
findd a Blood Bowl stadium, you're guaranteed to findd at least one
team made up of an assortment of thoroughly debased, dedicated
followers of Chaos. Most of the teams' players tend to be Beastmen,
hideous mutants who have given up their forest lairs for the sporting
life, but their numbers are bolstered by the presence of superhuman
Chosen, and frenzied and blood-crazed Minotaurs, Ogres and Trolls.
Such teams are hardly
![](media/core_rules/image350.jpg)subtle, often forgetting about the ball
entirely as they grind their opponents into the turf, all in
veneration of the Ruinous Powers they worship.

Chaos Renegade teams represent the real flootsam and jetsam of the
Blood Bowl world, players so maladjusted that no coach worth their
salt would let them play on their roster. They might be bitter
rejects, inveterate cheats or blatant foulers. Many are outcasts
expelled from established teams. Inevitably, such players end up
rejecting the ways of Nufflee and dedicating themselves to other dark
powers, often garnering themselves all manner of dubious mutations as
'rewards' in the process. The most successful team of this type was
the Chaos All-Stars, whose eccentrically mixed line-up managed to soar
to glory. Also of note is the (in)famous Mongrel Horde, a motley
assortment of scumbags in it
![](media/core_rules/image357.jpg)for the gold. Unfortunately, most of the
Horde's players hate each other, often refusing to play nicely or turn

**DARK ELF TEAMS**
N0TABLE EXAMPLES: THE NAGGAR0TH NIGHTWINGS, THE DARKSIDE C0WB0YS, THE
BLACK C0RSAIRS Thousands of years ago, the Dark Elves were little more
than a small group within High Elf society who turned their back on
traditional Elven ways. They eschewed nobility and grace for power and
glory, believing their immortality marked
them out as the most powerful of all the world's races. Their thirst
for conquest led to a bitter civil war that rocked the Elven kingdoms.
Dark Elf teams exhibit similar strengths and weaknesses to their Elven
cousins, but are distinctly more aggressive in their game. But sheer
spite makes the Dark Elves enjoy the running game, particularly when a
team includes a remarkable player like Jeremiah Kool. In fact, it is
hard to believe that the Flashing Blade won't be tempted
![](media/core_rules/image364.jpg)out of retirement - if not by the

Dwarfs were one of the very firrst races to play Blood Bowl and many
Dwarf teams can trace their history to the early years of the game.
Dwarfs tend to use a running game, grinding their opponents into the
ground as they go and working on the principle of high casualty rates
opening up the fieeld. There are so many Dwarf teams around that it is
possible to findd one to champion almost any style of play. It is,
however, the Dwarfs' reputation for flambooyant illegality that makes
them such a big hit with the fans. Since it was a Dwarf, now
immortalised by the name Roze-El, who firrst translated Nufflee's
sacred laws and brought the game into being, most Dwarf teams believe
they have a lasting right to alter the
![](media/core_rules/image371.jpg)laws as they choose.

Following the collapse of the NAF, many Elven teams found themselves
indebted to noble backers from the Elven kingdoms, who - thanks to a
lot of small print - began to make their way onto the pitch, shunting
established players to the sidelines. Outrage abounded among players
and fans alike, and it was only a matter of time before something was
done about it. When that something finallly happened, the formation of
the Elven Union came as a surprise to no one. A loose federation of
Elven teams, made up primarily of High Elf players but including the
odd Wood Elf and even Dark Elf, the Union seeks to repair the damaged
reputation of Elven teams and show that they can take Blood Bowl
seriously.

Goblins are cruel and uncouth, with a juvenile sense of humour and a
wicked imagination dedicated to discovering new ways of hurting others
without getting hurt themselves. This tends to make them better Blood
Bowl fans than players, and indeed Goblin fans have a solid reputation
throughout the Old World for turning up hours before the game, getting
drunk, starting fightts, singing lewd and insulting songs, and
generally causing trouble wherever they go. Unsurprisingly, Goblin
teams don't tend to do amazingly well on the pitch, but by Nufflee are
they entertaining! Their play style revolves around a seemingly
endless arsenal of 'secret' weapons which the Gobbos sneak onto the
pitch at every opportunity,
![](media/core_rules/image387.jpg)and the assistance of lumbering Trolls
who alternate between flinnging their smaller team-mates up the pitch
and absent-mindedly chewing on them instead!

**HALFLING TEAMS**
N0TABLE EXAMPLES: THE GREENFIELD GRASSHUGGERS, THE BLUEBAY CRAMMERS,

The technical deficienccy of Halflinng teams is legendary. They're too
short to throw or catch, they run at half pace, and it goes without
saying that their blocking game leaves something to be desired. Most
Halflinng coaches, aware of the material that they have to work with,
make up for quality with quantity. After all, if you can get half a
dozen players in the opposing team's End Zone and, by some miracle,
manage to end up with the ball, then there is a small chance that one
or two of them won't be jelly by the time you throw the thing!
Probably the only real point in the Halflinngs' favour is their
long-held alliance with the Treemen who guard the forests of their
realm, and a team that can tempt one (or two!) of
![](media/core_rules/image396.jpg)them along to a game suddenly doesn't

Professional Human players are widely considered to be the best

they may lack in the sheer strength of the Orcs, the agility of the
High Elves, the toughness of the Dwarfs, the frenzy of the Dark Elves,
or the speed of the Skaven, they make up for in sheer grit and
determination! More importantly, they do not suffer the weaknesses
commonly associated with any of these players. For example, where
Dwarfs are tough, they are also slow, Humans by contrast are hardy and
relatively quick, and whilst Skaven are very quick, they are not as
brave as Humans. It is hardly surprising then that Humans account for
over half of all Blood Bowl players - counting

hide from treasury men who ask bothersome questions, all these and
more are drawn to the sport. Some are lured by the presence of vast
wealth and long to liberate it from its current owners and keep it

prescient Lizardmen are. Whatever the story behind their involvement
in the sport, they've definittely made an impact! On the fieeld,
Lizardmen epitomise teamwork, with up to four different species
working together on the pitch at a time. Skinks are the most numerous
players, highly agile and as quick as lightning. They are balanced out
by Saurus, fewer in number and not as fast, but capable of dishing out
some serious punishment. Then

Many Necromancers, proficientt at corpse-raising and fleesh-crafting
but lacking a real plan of how to use their skills, realise that warm
dugouts are a lovely alternative to musty tombs and dank barrows, and
therefore decide to assemble a team of players (quite literally!).
Interestingly, a schism of sorts seems to have occurred, leading to
two competing philosophies when it comes to
![](media/core_rules/image430.jpg)coaching an Undead team. Some
Necromancers put their trust in the ancient dead. Other Necromancers
prefer a little more life in their team, buying the services of

conglomerate of followers of all of the Chaos gods, it didn't take
long for teams to be more selective in their choice of deity. On the
fieeld, Nurgle teams are a terrifying prospect to face. What they lack
in agility and coordination, they more than make up for with brute
strength, a natural resilience to harm and a whole playbook of
stomach-churning tactics devised to bring the other team to its knees.
Nurgle teams defy conventional definittion, being made up of
Rotters, players who have contracted one or more of Nurgle's many
blessings; Bloaters, players swollen with disease;
![](media/core_rules/image439.jpg)Pestigors, Beastmen attracted to the

At face value, the thought of an Ogre Blood Bowl team is enough to
filll most players with dread. Thankfully, the reality never quite
lives up to their worst fears. For starters, most Ogres are incredibly
dense. Just getting them to all turn up at the same time is a mammoth
task. Not to mention that very few coaches can afford to fieeld more
than a few Ogres at a time, meaning that most Ogre teams are bulked
out with Gnoblars. Then there's the fact that, no matter how much you
train them, the moment the whistle goes, most Ogres forget everything
and try to pound their opponents into a bloody mess. Coaches who know
what they're doing can turn this to their advantage, but it's a rare
sight to see an Ogre team

N0TABLE EXAMPLES: THE G0UGED EYE, DA DEFF SKWAD, THE GREEN DESTR0YERS
Orcs have been playing Blood Bowl since the game was discovered - in
fact it was an Orc who found the shrine where the sacred *Tome of
Nufflee* was hidden. Orc teams are very hard-hitting, concentrating on
pounding the opposition into the turf to create gaps through which Orc
Blitzers can run. Indeed, if any fault can be found with Orc teams, it
is that if they aren't fightting amongst themselves, they're spending
too much time beating up the other team! Orcs have always respected
brawn over intelligence, so their line of scrimmage is often
overloaded with Big Uns and Troll players, adding even more weight to
the front line. The Orc race also has close ties with other Greenskin
races such as Goblins, and it is
![](media/core_rules/image459.jpg)common to findd such players in Orc
teams.

The firrst Shambling Undead teams took to the gridiron a mere half
century ago, and it has taken much of that time for the Undead to
become accepted by the establishment. Today, they are a popular sight
on the pitch. Fans love to see the reanimated dead shambling about,
oblivious to all but the most debilitating of injuries, even as they
dish out
punishment to the opposition! Be it dry as dust Skeletons, their
marionette movements mocking the living, or fresh Zombies, their moans
and groans echoing around the pitch, accompanied by the fans\'
laughter at their awkward and stilted movements. Or from enraged
Mummies, their unearthly roars of anger setting pulses racing, to
sinister Ghouls
![](media/core_rules/image468.jpg)stalking the wide zones, eyeing the

The game of Blood Bowl has become very popular in all walks of Skaven
life. True to their warped nature, the Skaven have adapted the game in
their own special ways. A new clan has been formed to govern and
control the game - Clan Rigens - which consists of over 20 teams. The
most famous are the Skavenblight Scramblers, twice winners of the
Blood Bowl trophy. Several other teams have achieved successes in
other, lesser leagues and competitions too, and there are mixed teams
with a large proportion of Skaven competing at various levels. Of
course, their close association
![](media/core_rules/image476.jpg)with warpstone and the resulting
mutations have helped with this success, but even the basic Skaven
player has a lot going for them. It's only a matter of time before a
Skaven team makes it to the top again!

Snotlings are the smallest, and perhaps the most numerous, type of
Greenskin in the world. Tiny in stature and severely lacking any sense
of self-preservation, they are enthusiastic followers and players of
Blood Bowl. They sometimes
appear in Ogre teams, but Snotlings are often unwilling to take to the
fieeld alongside other races, believing as they so often do in
self-perpetuating myths of their own superiority. Such Snotlings swarm
together around a visionary coach in great numbers and take to the
pitch in a frenzy of enthusiasm. Officialss hate to see Snotling
teams, for various reasons,
![](media/core_rules/image485.jpg)chief amongst which is that Snotlings
can't (or, more correctly, won't) count and their ridiculously tiny
stature makes them nigh impossible to manage as they floodd onto the
pitch!

N0TABLE EXAMPLES: THE UNDERW0RLD CREEPERS, THE CRAGMERE CRITTERS, THE
DRAG0N-CRAG DIRTBAGS Ask any Goblinoid and they'll tell you that it's
not easy being a low-down sneaky git! Similarly, if you managed to
corner a Skaven long enough to get an answer out of them, they'd
probably tell you that living in the sewers is less fun than it looks.
It's not entirely clear when these very different races firrst joined
forces, but there's a good chance that the Underworld Creepers were
the firrst such team to take to the pitch. Fuelled by a heady elixir
of warpstone- infused mushrooms, Underworld Denizens teams combine the
sneakiness of Snotlings and Goblins with the speed
of Skaven; most are despised, but some of them have garnered a cult
following! The most popular tend to be those
![](media/core_rules/image492.jpg)who fieeld a Troll or Rat Ogre, hideous
and pallid mountains of slab-like muscle that serve as enforcers for
their smaller team-mates.

**WOOD ELF TEAMS**
N0TABLE EXAMPLES: THE ATHEL0RN AVENGERS, THE BIL BALI ARCHERS, THE
PINE CRAG PI0NEERS
Wood Elves make natural Blood Bowl players, although their refusal to
wear heavy armour does leave them vulnerable
to some of the more hard hitting teams. Generally, the Wood Elves'
natural athletic ability is enough to keep them out of trouble - it
takes a fast or cunning foe to catch a Wood Elf player. In any case,
no decent Wood Elf wants to wear bulky, shapeless armour, let alone be
seen in it! For Wood Elves the long pass is everything, even more so
than for their High
Elf cousins, and all of their effort goes into becoming experts at
throwing or receiving. The one exception to this is the Wood Elf
Wardancers. These athletic warriors are trained in the deadly arts of
hand-to-hand combat and are a match for
![](media/core_rules/image497.jpg)almost any foe.
