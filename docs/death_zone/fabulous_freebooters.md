For every player safely employed by a team, there are dozens of freelance players who will agree to wear anyone's colours in exchange for hard currency. Many competent and skilled players prefer the life of a freebooting mercenary to the strict rules and regulations imposed on players under permanent contract. OTHERs, including some of the  game's biggest stars, prefer to offerr their services on a game-by- game basis, allowing them to pick and choose the teams they play for and to charge the fee they want, often without the aggravation of haggling over money or contract details.

## EXPANDED RULES FOR MERCENARY PLAYERS

The rules presented here are an expansion of the rules for Mercenary Player Inducements contained within the Blood Bowl rulebook. At the discretion of league commissioners or event organisers, these rules may be used instead, in which case the following rules replace those found in the Blood Bowl rulebook.
If these rules are in use:

* The total number of Mercenaries available is reduced from ‘unlimited’ to 0-3.
* The number of each specificc type of Mercenary available to a team is detailed on the following pages.
* The rules for Mercenaries as detailed in the Blood Bowl rulebook are not used; those rules are completely replaced by the following rules.

These rules are designed to give coaches tremendous freedom in creating Mercenary players for their teams, allowing them to create a player suited to almost any situation. In addition, these rules can be used by league commissioners or event organisers wishing to create a unique Star Player to feature at their league or event. This has long been a popular feature of Blood Bowl leagues and events the world over, and these rules will make it easier than ever to correctly cost such unique and characterful players.

### 0-3 MERCENARY PLAYER INDUCEMENTS

**PRICE AND QUANTITY VARIES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM**

In league play, any team may purchase Mercenary Player Inducements during the pre-game sequence. How many can be purchased depends upon the type as described over the following pages. When a Mercenary player is purchased, their services are secured for that one game. The Mercenary is not added to the Team Draft list, but their player profile will need to be recorded for reference purposes for the benefitt of both coaches. Should you wish, Mercenary players can be named and even given a backstory, creating your own character that can then be Induced again ahead of any future fixtture.

Mercenary players never gain Star Player Points and cannot be awarded the MVP for a game. Mercenary players never gain any advancements other than those taken when they are created. Unless the league commissioner decides otherwise, any Casualty table results applied against a Mercenary player are waived after the game they, like Star Players, are assumed to employ their own staff of healers and medics to keep them in peak condition.

In exhibition play, Mercenary players, like any other Inducement, can be purchased when the team is drafted, as described in the *Blood Bowl* rulebook.

Mercenary players may not take the number of players in the team to more than 16. However, in league play, players that are missing the game due to injury do not count towards the number of players on the team, so they are not counted towards the 16 player limit when working out how many Mercenary players a team can purchase.

**CREATING A MERCENARY**

To create a Mercenary player, the first thing to do is decide upon the type. There are fivve broad types of Mercenary player to choose from: Stunty Superstars, Legendary Lineman, Brutal Blockers, Reliable Ringers or Bona Fide Big Guys. Each type has a profile which includes a selection of Skills and Traits, and a basic hiring fee in
gold pieces.

To this profile you have the option to add certain additional Skills or Traits, or to improve characteristics. Most of these additions and improvements increase the basic hiring fee of the Mercenary, but some may reduce the hiring fee. This means that you are given the opportunity to create the perfect Mercenary at a premium price, or to create a Mercenary who comes complete with a few flaaws and a healthy discount!

Note, however, that some of these options are not available to all teams. For example, a Stunty Superstar can gain the Bombardier and Secret Weapon traits, but only if they are hired by a team that has one, or more, of the 'Badlands Brawl', 'Halflinng Thimble Cup', 'Old World Classic', 'Underworld Challenge' or 'Worlds Edge Superleague' special rules.

Once your Mercenary has been created, you will need to record their profile and their hiring fee. Hopefully, your team will have sufficientt funds available to afford your creation!

### 0-2 STUNTY SUPERSTARS MERCENARY PLAYER INDUCEMENTS

**30,000 GOLD PIECES PLUS OPTIONS, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM**

Of all the denizens of the Old World, there are few that can inspire more confidencce in an opposing team than Halflinngs or Goblins. These diminutive players lack the height, weight and physical strength of, for example, Humans or 0rcs and, whilst they often display an agility comparable to that of an Elf, they sorely lack the speed and grace required to make the best use of such agility on the Blood Bowl pitch.

Yet, over the years, there has been no shortage of Goblin and Halflinng Blood Bowl players. Members of both races take to Nuffle's sacred gridiron in numbers beyond counting in search of glory and fame, hoping to make it as big-time stars and, in so doing, break free of the prejudice that all too often accompanies their small stature. Sadly, for most of these eager young players, their sporting adventure is (appropriately enough) really rather short, usually ending in a premature death!

But for every hundred Stunty players (as these diminutive hopefuls are called by the larger races of the world) whose career culminates in an amusing death, there will be one or two that will survive long enough to attain some measure of the success that drives them.

Over time, these players grow in skill and experience if not in stature. It is not unknown for many such veteran Stunty players to strike out on their own as mercenary players, offering their unique services to the highest bidder and building upon their legend.

Many such Stunty players look for an edge in the game, an extra something that will not only improve their performance but often keep them alive in the face of spirited attempts by the opposition to see them retired! For this reason, it is not uncommon to see Stunty Superstars equipped with all manner of gimmicks or armed with a variety of secret weapons. From stilts to chainsaws, pogo sticks to bombs, Stunty players have tried them all! By bringing such devious devices to the pitch, these players increase their value no end in the eyes of potential employers, for the sight of a Halflinng equipped with a chainsaw or a Goblin bounding down the pitch on a pogo stick is often so hilarious as to pass without comment by the average referee, who will usually place the entertainment of the crowd above such petty concerns as the upholding of the rules (for a drive or two at any rate). More importantly, such ludicrous sights often prove so amusingly disarming to the opposition that many an overly-bold player has literally died laughing at the sight of an overly-armed and armoured Goblin advancing towards them with a look of determination in their beady eyes!

### 0-2 LEGENDARY LINEMEN MERCENARY PLAYER INDUCEMENTS

**50,000 GOLD PIECES PLUS OPTIONS, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM**

Blood Bowl players come in all shapes and sizes, and their unique abilities are many and varied. For the most part, it is those that display exceptional athletic ability in some particular aspect of the game, be it as throwers, blitzers, runners or catchers, that come to be the most renowned of Star Players, the most beloved of fans and the most in demand amongst potential employers. The humble lineman, arguably the backbone of any team, is often overlooked when Cabalvision shows are looking for players to interview, or when the awards are being handed out at the end of the season.

This is a terrible shame, for without a strong core of high quality linemen, no team can achieve true success! It matters not how competent the thrower, how bold the blitzer, how fast the runner or how agile the catcher if the humble linemen have failed in their job of either holding back the opposition's offensive line, or forcing through their defensive line!

Yet the hard working linemen continue to be ignored and overlooked by coaches, team owners and sponsors alike. Consequently, many a talented player chooses instead to strike out on their own, offering their valuable services to those coaches who do recognise their need and are willing to pay a princely sum for some competence upon the line of scrimmage. At a glance, this may seem foolish; what sane lineman would give up the security of regular employment as a professional Blood Bowl player for the uncertainty of life as a mercenary? Surely, no one is beating a path to their door with offers of work!

Upon closer examination, the question becomes: "Who wouldn't?

Most professional Blood Bowl players are tied into contractual obligations that cannot easily be escaped. In this position, linemen are rarely paid what they think they are worth and are, as has been stated, constantly underappreciated. Combined with an obligation to tolerate team-mates or coaches they privately can't stand, it becomes easy to see
the appeal of life as a self-employed player. Those who choose the life of a mercenary suffer few of the hardships that those tied into contracts must endure. They can leave when they want, they don't have to pretend to like people they don't like and, above all else, they can charge what they wish! After all, if one coach won't pay their fee, another will.

The vast majority of these mercenary players are seasoned, competent veterans of the game. They know their job and do it well, whether it is anchoring the line of scrimmage in defence, forcing a wedge through the opposition on defence, or the more clandestine art of fouling a downed opponent when no officialss are looking!

### 0-1 BRUTAL BLOCKERS MERCENARY PLAYER INDUCEMENTS

**70,000 GOLD PIECES PLUS OPTIONS, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM**

The game of Blood Bowl is known to attract a great many very large and very violent individuals. More than its fair share, some commentators have commented! But is this really so surprising? It is only natural that a six-foot-four-inches tall, three- hundred-pound Black 0rc with a penchant for smashing skulls should be drawn to a violent blood sport rather than a career in, for example, customer services. True, both of these fields would allow such an unbalanced individual ample opportunityto satisfy their violent and antisocial tendencies, but a career as a Blood Bowl player also offerrs plenty of healthy exercise outside in the fresh air!

Most teams are keen to hire such players, recognising their gifts and appreciating the value that a big, strong and, above all, violent brute of a player brings to the pitch. Be it anchoring the line of scrimmage, guarding the wide zones, or hanging back and hunting opposing receivers and blitzers that make the mistake of advancing upon the end zone, having a very large and strong player to hand ready to unleash decades of anger in a single violent outburst is never a bad thing! Well, unless, of course, the opposition has such players on their team sheet as well.

Many such players are Human, grown large through good eating and plenty of exercise. Others are drawn from the northern tribes; mighty champions of Chaos who have taken to the life of a Blood Bowl player to further their progress along the path to glory or damnation. Still others are Orcs, grown so large and brutal as to stand out even amongst their own, violent kind, whilst others are Black Orcs; brutal and cunning savages from the Dark Lands. Some might be Dwarfs of the Worlds Edge Mountains, a folk renowned for their strength, if not for their speed. Still others might be more exotic in origin; Saurus from Lustria, strange undead constructs and other, more peculiar creatures besides.

Coincidentally, many such players find themselves drawn into the freebooting life of a mercenary player. Many pundits have theorised that this is likely because most teams feel uncomfortable about the idea of sharing their changing room with a violent psychopath. This theory is easily disproved and quite clearly nonsense as the majority of players are demonstrably violent psychopaths; it's why they play the game in the first place! In truth, most mercenary players struggle to manage the authority and discipline that comes with regular training as part of a team to a greater or lesser extent. In this regard Brutal Blockers are no different to any other mercenary player, preferring to be their own boss, joining a team for a few games, but leaving before the stress of commitment becomes too great!

### 0-2 RELIABLE RINGERS MERCENARY PLAYER INDUCEMENTS

**70,000 GOLD PIECES PLUS OPTIONS, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM**

Despite all the brutality and violence on the pitch, all the secret weapons, all the fouling, cheating, corruption and, above all, the endlessly entertaining bloodshed, Blood Bowl is a game of finesse and skill. True, those players that excel in the simple art of flatttening opponents through the precise application of force are in high demand and can always earn a good fee, but those that are consistently the most sought after are those that excel in the athletic art form that is Blood Bowl! 

Talented players are always in high demand for the expertise they can bring to a team, and the most accomplished are able to demand some serious remuneration for their services. Be it the speed and agility of an Elven runner, the expert aim and strong arm of a Human thrower, or even the stealthy threat of a skilled and deadly assassin, players that exemplify the grace and elegance of classical Blood Bowl as first laid down in Nuffle's sacred texts are never short of offers.

For most such players, this means securing a steady contract with an established team and enjoying the security this brings and the adoration of an enthusiastic fanbase. There is a lot to be said for practising with a team for months, even years, learning to function as a whole and competing for the biggest prizes and greatest sporting honours in the company of one's friends. For others, this is clearly a load of emotional nonsense. Many players of huge talent and almost limitless natural ability are quick to cast aside a regular gig and instead take enthusiastically to the life of a mercenary. For such players, selling their superior abilities on a game-by-game basis to the highest bidder is undeniably the better option, and anyone who says otherwise clearly hasn't seen what they get paid!

This sort of ruthlessly mercenary attitude towards the game in general, and sporting glory in particular, works just fine for a great many talented players. It is certainly  true that there is never a shortage of teams looking to hire a Reliable Ringer for an important fixtture or two. Whilst most coaches will hire mercenaries for their muscle, the cleverest and most cunning will save their cash, investing in an expert thrower or a superstar runner at just the right time, knowing that the skill they bring can be the difference between winning and losing a key game, and knowing that their opponents won't be expecting a sudden and dramatic change in tactics. Sometimes, such bold tactics  backfirre; it is not uncommon for a team suddenly joined by a player whose style differs to theirs so greatly to struggle, but usually the added talent during a key fixtture pays dividends!

### 0-1 BONA FIDE BIG GUY MERCENARY PLAYER INDUCEMENTS
*130,000 GOLD PIECES PLUS OPTIONS, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM*


rom gluttonous 0gres to frenzied
Minotaurs, dim-witted Trolls to savage Rat 0gres, Big Guys are
perennially-popular

players. The fans never fail to enjoy the on-pitch antics of these
giants of the game, be it mighty feats of strength such as hurling
other, smaller players the length of the pitch, or outbursts of
unreasoning violence, directed indiscriminately towards friend and foe
alike, Big Guys never
fail to entertain the masses!

etter still, the vast majority of Big Guys are incredibly stupid
individuals. Many are notoriously prone to mixing up even the most
simple of well-

drilled plays and forgetting not only where they are, but why they are
there and what is going on around them.
The scale upon which the average Big Guy can seriously mess up is
truly endless! There have been times when a particularly confused and
bewildered Big Guy has been known to simply stand aside and let an
opposing player pass by on their way to the end zone or, on more than
one memorable (and hysterical, from the perspective of the fans!)
occasion, to obligingly hand over the ball to a player on the opposing
team for no other reason than that they asked politely!

Such gaffs are undeniably frustrating for coaches; their tortured
wails of despair greeted with cheers and

applause from the stands becoming a mainstay of game


day entertainment and a universally accepted element
of fan interaction. But it is not only the coaches that feel the
frustration. Many a hardcore fan has felt the anguish
of seeing their beloved team's stalwart Big Guy simply switch off to the
action around them, preferring to stare into the middle distance,
philosophising deeply upon
some unknowable concern whilst dreamily excavating
the contents of one cavernous nostril. Such moments of despair are
fleeeting for the fans, however, usually replaced by the simple joy of
taking out one's frustrations on a rival fan, punishing their cruel
amusement with angrily-thrown food wrappers, drinks containers, insults,
and even fistts!

This hopeless unreliability has caused many a pundit
to question the logic of including Big Guys on teams at all;

why would a coach put themselves through the torture of fielding a
player so likely to mess up at a critical moment? Why would a coach wish
to go through the heartache
and stress of trying to train such a player to perform in
the first place? The answer to these questions, though, is simple; when
a Big Guy does get things right, the results can be spectacular! The
strength they bring to the pitch is undeniable, the violence they are
capable of unleashing endlessly inspirational, and the fear a Big Guy
can instil in the opposition invaluable!

It's no wonder that they are ever in such high demand.
