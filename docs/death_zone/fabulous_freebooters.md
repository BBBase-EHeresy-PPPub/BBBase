For every player safely employed by a team, there are dozens of freelance players who will agree to wear anyone's colours in exchange for hard currency. Many competent and skilled players prefer the life of a freebooting mercenary to the strict rules and regulations imposed on players under permanent contract. OTHERs, including some of the game's biggest stars, prefer to offer their services on a game-by- game basis, allowing them to pick and choose the teams they play for and to charge the fee they want, often without the aggravation of haggling over money or contract details.

## EXPANDED RULES FOR MERCENARY PLAYERS

The rules presented here are an expansion of the rules for Mercenary Player Inducements contained within the Blood Bowl rulebook. At the discretion of league commissioners or event organisers, these rules may be used instead, in which case the following rules replace those found in the Blood Bowl rulebook.
If these rules are in use:

* The total number of Mercenaries available is reduced from 'unlimited' to 0-3.
* The number of each specific type of Mercenary available to a team is detailed on the following pages.
* The rules for Mercenaries as detailed in the Blood Bowl rulebook are not used; those rules are completely replaced by the following rules.

These rules are designed to give coaches tremendous freedom in creating Mercenary players for their teams, allowing them to create a player suited to almost any situation. In addition, these rules can be used by league commissioners or event organisers wishing to create a unique Star Player to feature at their league or event. This has long been a popular feature of Blood Bowl leagues and events the world over, and these rules will make it easier than ever to correctly cost such unique and characterful players.

## 0-3 MERCENARY PLAYER INDUCEMENTS

**PRICE AND QUANTITY VARIES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM**

In league play, any team may purchase Mercenary Player Inducements during the pre-game sequence. How many can be purchased depends upon the type as described over the following pages. When a Mercenary player is purchased, their services are secured for that one game. The Mercenary is not added to the Team Draft list, but their player profile will need to be recorded for reference purposes for the benefit of both coaches. Should you wish, Mercenary players can be named and even given a backstory, creating your own character that can then be Induced again ahead of any future fixture.

Mercenary players never gain Star Player Points and cannot be awarded the MVP for a game. Mercenary players never gain any advancements other than those taken when they are created. Unless the league commissioner decides otherwise, any Casualty table results applied against a Mercenary player are waived after the game they, like Star Players, are assumed to employ their own staff of healers and medics to keep them in peak condition.

In exhibition play, Mercenary players, like any other Inducement, can be purchased when the team is drafted, as described in the *Blood Bowl* rulebook.

Mercenary players may not take the number of players in the team to more than 16. However, in league play, players that are missing the game due to injury do not count towards the number of players on the team, so they are not counted towards the 16 player limit when working out how many Mercenary players a team can purchase.

**CREATING A MERCENARY**

To create a Mercenary player, the first thing to do is decide upon the type. There are five broad types of Mercenary player to choose from: Stunty Superstars, Legendary Lineman, Brutal Blockers, Reliable Ringers or Bona Fide Big Guys. Each type has a profile which includes a selection of Skills and Traits, and a basic hiring fee in gold pieces.

To this profile you have the option to add certain additional Skills or Traits, or to improve characteristics. Most of these additions and improvements increase the basic hiring fee of the Mercenary, but some may reduce the hiring fee. This means that you are given the opportunity to create the perfect Mercenary at a premium price, or to create a Mercenary who comes complete with a few flaws and a healthy discount!

Note, however, that some of these options are not available to all teams. For example, a Stunty Superstar can gain the Bombardier and Secret Weapon traits, but only if they are hired by a team that has one, or more, of the 'Badlands Brawl', 'Halfling Thimble Cup', 'Old World Classic', 'Underworld Challenge' or 'Worlds Edge Superleague' special rules.

Once your Mercenary has been created, you will need to record their profile and their hiring fee. Hopefully, your team will have sufficient funds available to afford your creation!
