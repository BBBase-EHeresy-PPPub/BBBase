**NEW** **WEATHER** **TABLES**

![](../media/death_zone/image278.jpg)**B**

f both coaches agree, they can use one of the following tables in
place of the Weather table

in the *Blood Bowl* rulebook for the duration of the game. This is
ideal
for representing those games played

at different times of the year and in different seasons, as well as
those played in more extreme environments, such as the sweltering heat
of the Badlands, or in the frozen chill
of Norsca.

A league commissioner may also decide that an entire league season is
being held at a particular time

of year, or in a specific,, and perhaps less hospitable, part of the
world.
In such cases, all games played during that league season can
use one of the following tables
as determined by the league commissioner to represent the overriding
conditions.

If these tables are in use, any other rules that refer to the Weather
table (for example, the Changing Weather result on the Kick-off Event
table)
refer automatically to the table that
is in use, rather than the standard table in the *Blood Bowl*
rulebook.

SPRING WEATHER TABLE
With the cold months of winter a rapidly-receding memory, spring has
well
and truly sprung! Blood Bowl teams the world over are taking to the
pitch
once more, whilst the fans flocck back to the bleachers in their droves.
What a wonderful time of year!

SPRING WEATHER TABLE

2D6 RESULT
2 *Morning Dew:* The pitch is dew-covered from the cold of night,

making everything a little slippery. Apply a -1 modifierr every time a
player attempts to Rush an extra square.
Additionally, apply a -1 modifierr every time a player makes an
Agility test to pick up the ball.

3 *Blossoming Flowers :* The floowers are blooming, the tree sap is
pumping and the pollen count is high, forcing the hay fever-affliccted

referee to seek shelter indoors. Whilst this weather condition is in
effect, players cannot be Sent-off for committing a Foul, even if they
roll a natural double on either the Armour roll or the Injury roll.

4-10 *Perfect Conditions (well, almost):* It's not quite warm but then
again, it's not quite cold ideal weather for a game of Blood Bowl!

11 *Misty Morning:* A haze of thick mist has descended upon the pitch,

greatly reducing visibility. Players can move only a maximum of six
squares, although they may still Rush as normal.
Additionally, only Quick and Short pass actions can be performed.

12 *High Winds:* The winds are whistling through the stadium and the
players can barely hear each other. Roll a D6 each time a player on
your team wishes to use a team re-roll. On a roll of 2+, you may use a

team re-roll as normal. On a 1, a team re-roll cannot be used.

SUMMER WEATHER TABLE
Summer is well and truly here! The days are long, the
sky blue, and absolutely everyone wants nothing more than to spend the
long, hot afternoons watching a game and catching some rays! Well,
some of the players aren't so keen; it is far too hot for running
around!

SUMMER WEATHER TABLE

![](../media/death_zone/image281.jpg)2D6 RESULT
2 *Sweltering Heat:* Some players faint in the

unbearable heat! D3 randomly selected players from each team that are
on the pitch when
a drive ends are placed in the Reserves box.
They must miss the next drive.

3 *Melting Astrogranite:* It's not just the players that are affected
by the hot weather even the pitch is melting! It might be the heat, or
it might
be the sticky footing, but the players are certainly

struggling to move! The number of squares a player can attempt to Rush
is reduced by one (to
a minimum of one).

4-10 *Perfect Conditions (well, almost):* It's still hot,

but not as hot as it has been lately!
A (tolerably) warm, dry and slightly overcast day provides perfect
conditions for Blood Bowl.

11 *Blinding Rays:* No cloud cover in the clear, blue

skies and the relentless glare of the sun leaves the players squinting
and shading their eyes.
Apply a -1 modifierr every time a player tests against their Passing
Ability.
Additionally, only Quick and Short pass actions can be performed.

12 *Monsoon:* A sudden burst of torrential rain and high winds hits
the pitch, making the ball slippery

and erratic. Apply a -1 modifierr every time a
player makes an Agility test to catch or pick up
the ball, or to attempt to interfere with a pass. Additionally, when
the ball scatters, it moves
from the square in which it was placed four times before landing,
rather than the usual three.

AUTUMN WEATHER TABLE
The year continues to turn, the days are shortening and there is a chill
in the air! The players love this time of year; the unbearable heat is
gone and the fallen leaves soften their frequent falls. The fans too
enjoy the crisp air, if not the bitterly cold winds!

AUTUMN WEATHER TABLE

2D6 RESULT
2 *Leaf-strewn Pitch:* Huge drifts of leaves

have piled up at regular intervals across the pitch. It looks
terrible, but they're soft to land
on! When a player Falls Over or is Knocked
Down, the coach of the opposing team must apply a -1 modifierr when
making an Armour roll against them.

3 *Autumnal Chill:* Winter is fast approaching and

players are reluctant to leave the comfortable warmth of the dugout.
During the End of Drive sequence, apply a -1 modifierr when rolling to
see

if a player recovers from being KO'd.
4-10 *Perfect Conditions (well, almost):* It's not

quite warm, but then again it's not quite
cold ideal Blood Bowl weather! A pleasant autumn afternoon provides
perfect conditions
for Blood Bowl.

11 *Pouring Rain:* A torrential downpour leaves the

players soaked and the ball very slippery! Apply
a -1 modifierr every time a player makes an Agility test to catch or
pick up the ball, or to attempt to interfere with a pass.

12 *Strong Winds:* If it wasn't for the winds, it
would be a lovely day. The ball does not deviate

normally. Instead, after placing the kick, the
coach of the kicking team rolls a D8 to determine the direction in
which the wind is blowing:

D8 Wind Direction
1-2 Towards the kicking team's End Zone.
3-4 Towards the receiving team's End Zone.
5-6 Towards the Sideline to the left of the

kicking team.
7-8 Towards the Sideline to the right of the

kicking team.
Next, place the Throw-in template over the square

in which the kick was placed, with the central arrow (3-4) pointing in
the direction in which
the wind is blowing. The kick then deviates in a direction determined
by rolling a D6 and referring to the Throw-in template.
Additionally, the number of squares the
ball moves is determined by rolling a D8,
rather than a D6.

WINTER WEATHER TABLE
Winter is well and truly settled upon the land. The days
are short and the nights long. Deep snow covers the pitch and
continues to fall heavily from the leaden sky. Some dedicated fans
would describe it as a 'winter wonderland', but most are at home,
watching the magic mirror!

WINTER WEATHER TABLE

![](../media/death_zone/image282.jpg)2D6 RESULT
2 *Cold Winds:* The fans are shivering in the stands

as a viciously cold wind blows steadily down the pitch. Apply a -1
modifierr every time a player
tests against their Passing Ability.
Players also find it harder to get motivated and
get back on the pitch. Additionally, during Step 2 of the End of Drive
sequence, apply a -1 modifierr when rolling to see if any player in
the Knocked- out box recovers.

3 *Freezing:* A sudden cold snap turns the ground as hard as granite
(and not the 'astro' variety that

players are used to). When a player Falls Over
or is Knocked Down, the coach of the opposing team must apply a +1
modifierr when making an Armour roll against them.

4-10 *Perfect Conditions (well, almost):* It's rather

chilly and it's threatening to rain (or snow), but considering the
time of year, the conditions are almost perfect for Blood Bowl.

11 *Heavy Snow:* The snow is several feet deep,

making it very difficcult indeed to run up and
punch someone! When a player performs a Block action as part of a
Blitz action (but not on its own), their Strength characteristic is
reduced
by 1 when comparing their Strength against the Strength of the target
of the Block action.

12 *Blizzard:* Freezing conditions and heavy falls of

snow make the footing treacherous. Apply a -1 modifierr every time a
player attempts to Rush an extra square.
Additionally, the poor visibility means that only Quick and Short
passes can be attempted.

SUBTERRANEAN WEATHER TABLE
Whilst the weather outside is frightful, the average underground stadium
is no better! Playing underground often seems like a good idea, but it
rarely ever is; the roof is too low, the footing too treacherous, and
there's the constant threat of earthquakes and cave-ins!

SUBTERRANEAN WEATHER TABLE

2D6 RESULT
2 *Bubbling up from Below:* The players are

aghast as viscous liquid begins to seep up from below. Whether this is
a natural phenomenon,
the result of sabotage or a dire warning that
stadia have no place being built above sewage pipes, it's definittely
not pleasant. All players on
the pitch subtract 1 from their MA.

3 *Gloomy:* The torches are in need of replacing,
and the shadows are growing long. All Long pass

and Long bomb Pass actions suffer an additional
-1 modifierr.
Additionally, when a player attempts to Rush
for a second or subsequent time during their activation, apply an
additional -1 modifierr.

4-10 *Perfect Conditions (well, almost):* The light of

the sun might be missing, but the conditions are almost perfect for
Blood Bowl.

11 *Thermal Geysers:* Vapour begins to whistle up

from cracks in the ground, followed by forceful gouts of roiling
steam. If a player on your team Falls Over or is Knocked Down, roll a
D6.

On a roll of 1, they crack open a thermal geyser. That player is
immediately catapulted through the air. Immediately treat that player
as being thrown (as if they had the Right Stuff trait) by another
player (with the Throw Team-mate trait), and treat the quality of the
throw as terrible.

12 *Seismic Activity:* "Uh oh was that a tremor? Roll a D6 at the end
of each team turn, adding 1

to the result for each player on the pitch with
a Strength of 5 or more. On a roll of 6+, rocks tumble down from up
above. Both coaches roll
off. The coach that rolls the lowest randomly selects one of their
players from among those on the pitch. That player is struck by a
falling rock
and Knocked Down.
If the roll-off results in a tie, do not roll again. Instead, both
coaches must randomly select a player to be struck by a falling rock.

PRIM0RDIAL RAINF0REST WEATHER
The tropical jungles of the world are hot, humid and
deeply hostile environments! The heat is ever-present and utterly
exhausting for all but the fitttest of players. But it's not just the
heat that teams must contend with. The rain is almost constant, a
near-continual deluge that can floodd a stadium in mere moments!

![](../media/death_zone/image283.jpg)PRIM0RDIAL RAINF0REST WEATHER TABLE

2D6 RESULT
2 *Praise the Sun Gods:* The sun beats down upon

the jungle canopy, turning the air below into a furnace and turning
the ground to rock! If a player Falls Over whilst Rushing, apply a +1
modifierr to the Armour roll. Additionally, apply all of the Heat Wave
weather condition rules as well.

3 *Heat Wave:* A glorious day, but as the heat
begins to rise, it becomes harder for players to

push themselves. Apply a -1 modifierr every time
a player attempts to Rush an extra square.
Players also find it harder to get motivated and
get back on the pitch. Additionally, during Step 2
of the End of Drive sequence, apply a -1 modifierr when rolling to see
if any player in the Knocked- out box recovers.

4-10 *Perfect Conditions (well, almost):* It's muggy

and the mosquitos are out, but otherwise it's perfect Blood Bowl
weather.

11 *Jungle Showers:* It's raining those big, fat jungle

raindrops, making the ball slippery and difficcult
to hold. Apply a -1 modifierr every time a player makes an Agility
test to pick up or catch the
ball, or whenever a player attempts to interfere with a pass.

12 *Tropical Monsoon:* Sheets of rain pour through the tree canopy
creating a wall of water, the

ground becomes boggy and visibility is severely reduced. While the
monsoon persists, only Quick pass or Short pass actions can be
attempted and the number of squares a player can attempt to Rush is
reduced by one (to a minimum of 1).

"There! Mark that one down!
In the third minute of the second half, player number 8, Urgar Rancid
of
the 0rcland Raiders, did wilfully
and without hesitation engage in
an illegally -- shockingly, if you will
-- high block against his opposite number, Grumli Boriksson.
The irascible fiend!!"

*Bronur Steel-eye, assistant coach,* *the Grudge Bearers*

GRAVEYARD WEATHER TABLE
From the desolate Howling Hills to the rural backwaters of Sylvania,
the world is full of many eerie places and spooky stadia. As if it
wasn't bad enough to have to play a game on a pitch covered in
gravestones, matters get worse when the weather gets atmospheric!

GRAVEYARD WEATHER TABLE

2D6 RESULT
2 *Angry Locals:* An angry mob of locals has arrived at the stadium
looking for the town Necromancer. Unable to

![](../media/death_zone/image284.jpg)find the fiendd, they decide he's
disguised himself as one of the players! Both coaches roll off. The
coach that rolls the lowest randomly selects one of their players from
among those on the pitch. That player is immediately removed from the
pitch and placed in the Reserves box, where they will hide until the
end of the game, or until this weather condition is replaced by
another.
If the roll-off results in a tie, do not roll again. Instead, both
coaches must randomly select a player to hide from the locals.
If this weather condition is rolled again, this process is repeated;
the locals are nothing if not generous in their misplaced suspicion of
the players!

3 *Fog:* A real pea-souper has descended, reducing visibility to
almost nothing! While the fog persists, only Quick pass or Short pass
actions can be attempted and the number of squares a player can
attempt to Rush is

reduced by one (to a minimum of 1).
Additionally, the referee is far less likely to spot any foul play
that occurs. Whilst this weather condition is in effect, players
cannot be Sent-off for committing a Foul, even if they roll a natural
double on either the Armour roll or the Injury roll.

4-10 *Perfect Conditions (well, almost):* It's a bit gloomy, and
there's a strong suggestion of faint voices

whispering too quietly to be heard, but otherwise it's perfect Blood
Bowl weather.
11 *Pouring Rain:* A torrential downpour leaves the players soaked and
the ball very slippery! Apply a -1 modifierr

every time a player makes an Agility test to catch or pick up the
ball, or to attempt to interfere with a pass.
12 *Lightning:* Thunder rumbles and the night sky is lit up by regular
lightning strikes. At the end of every team

turn, roll a D6. On a roll of 1, a single randomly selected player on
the active team is struck by lightning and immediately Knocked Down.
When a player is Knocked Down by lightning, you may apply a +1
modifierr to
either the Armour roll or Injury roll. This modifierr may be applied
after the roll has been made.

DES0LATE WASTELAND WEATHER TABLE
From the Badlands to the Border Princes, much of the world consists of
trackless wilderness and desolate, inhospitable places where the
hostile land is cheap
to acquire. Perfect for building a Blood Bowl stadium on! True, there
might be earthquakes and volcanoes, but if the price is right...

![](../media/death_zone/image285.jpg)DES0LATE WASTELAND WEATHER TABLE

2D6 RESULT
2 *Tremors:* The ground is constantly shaking and

shuddering. At the end of every team turn, roll a D6 for each Standing
player on the active team that is currently on the pitch. On a roll of
1, that player loses their balance and is Placed Prone.

3 *Pouring Rain:* A torrential downpour leaves the

players soaked and the ball very slippery! Apply
a -1 modifierr every time a player makes an Agility test to catch or
pick up the ball, or to attempt to interfere with a pass.

4-10 *Perfect Conditions (well, almost):* It's not
quite warm but then again, it's not quite cold

ideal weather for a game of Blood Bowl!
11 *Lava Bombs:* A local volcano is erupting a bit,

causing lumps of volcanic rock to rain down for miles around. Whilst
this weather condition is
in effect, all players are considered to have the Bone Head trait
representing them constantly looking skyward to avoid being struck by
unexpected lumps of falling rock.

12 *Strong Winds:* If it wasn't for the winds, it
would be a lovely day. The ball does not deviate

normally. Instead, after placing the kick, the
coach of the kicking team rolls a D8 to determine the direction in
which the wind

is blowing:

D8 Wind Direction
1-2 Towards the kicking team's End Zone.
3-4 Towards the receiving team's End Zone.
5-6 Towards the Sideline to the left of the

kicking team.
7-8 Towards the Sideline to the right of the

kicking team.
Next, place the Throw-in template over the square

in which the kick was placed, with the central arrow (3-4) pointing in
the direction in which
the wind is blowing. The kick then deviates in a direction determined
by rolling a D6 and referring to the Throw-in template.
Additionally, the number of squares the
ball moves is determined by rolling a D8,
rather than a D6.

M0UNTAIN0US WEATHER TABLE
Up in the high peaks, the air is clear and the sun is bright, the
perfect location to play some Blood Bowl, right?
Wrong! Assuming some flaat ground can be found, the wind blows a
constant gale, the sun is blinding, and sudden snow and ice storms
strike without warning! Oh well, we're here now...

2 *Gale Force Winds:* The wind is unbelievably

strong, making passing play impossible and
even affecting the kick-off! Whilst this weather condition is in

possible for a kick-off
to be resolved and a touchback is automatically caused instead.
Additionally, whilst this weather condition is in effect, no Pass
actions or Throw Team-mate actions can be performed.

3 *Very Sunny:* A glorious day, but the clear skies

and bright sunlight interfere with the passing game! Apply a -1
modifierr every time a player tests against their Passing Ability.

4-10 *Perfect Conditions (well, almost):* It's rather

chilly and it's threatening to rain (or snow), but considering the
time of year, the conditions are almost perfect for Blood Bowl.

11 *Blizzard:* Freezing conditions and heavy falls of

snow make the footing treacherous. Apply a -1 modifierr every time a
player attempts to Rush an extra square.
Additionally, the poor visibility means that only Quick and Short
passes can be attempted.

12 *Ice Storm:* It is extremely cold, so cold in fact that it is
raining literal lumps of ice! The ice on the pitch is so treacherous
that none of the

players are willing to hurry, no matter how much their coach shouts!
Apply a -1 modifierr every time a player attempts to Rush an extra
square. Additionally, all players on the pitch subtract 1 from their
MA.

C0ASTAL WEATHER TABLE
It's lovely by the coast at this time of year; miles and miles of
golden beaches, secluded bays, picturesque little seaside towns. But
the weather can change in the blink of an eye, one moment it's calm
and serene, the next moment the rain is literally sheeting down!

after placing the kick, the coach of the kicking team rolls a D8 to
determine the direction in which the
wind is blowing:

D8 Wind Direction

3-4 Towards the receiving team's End Zone.
5-6 Towards the Sideline to the left of the kicking team.
7-8 Towards the Sideline to the right of the kicking team.

Next, place the Throw-in template over the square in which the kick
was placed, with the central arrow (3-4) pointing in the direction in
which the wind is blowing. The kick then deviates in a direction
determined by rolling a D6 and referring to the Throw-in template.
Additionally, the number of squares the ball moves is determined by
rolling a D8, rather than a D6.

4-10 *Perfect Conditions (well, almost):* Neither too cold nor too
hot. A warm, dry and slightly overcast day

provides perfect conditions for Blood Bowl.
11 *Torrential Rain:* A torrential downpour is making the ball
slippery and difficcult to hold. Apply a -1 modifierr

every time a player makes an Agility test to catch or pick up the
ball, or to attempt to interfere with a pass. Additionally, the poor
visibility means that only Quick and Short passes can be attempted.
Finally, all players on the pitch subtract 1 from their MA.
However, such extreme downpours seldom last long. During the End of
Drive sequence, after Step 2 but before Step 3, roll again on the
Weather table.

12 *Blizzard:* Freezing conditions and heavy falls of snow make the
footing treacherous. Apply a -1 modifierr every

time a player attempts to Rush an extra square.
Additionally, the poor visibility means that only Quick and Short
passes can be attempted.

DESERT WEATHER TABLE
From the dusty shores of Araby to the endless expanses
of the Land of the Dead, much of the world is covered by great
deserts. These trackless expanses are often not the most welcoming of
environments, but they are very common, and if nothing else, very
flaat!

Next, place the Throw-in template over the square in which the kick
was placed, with the central arrow (3-4) pointing in the direction
in which the wind is blowing. The kick then deviates in a direction
determined by rolling a D6 and referring to the Throw-in template.
Additionally, the number of squares the ball moves is determined by
rolling a D8, rather than a D6.

12 *Sandstorm:* The shifting sands have been stirred up into a violent

sandstorm and visibility is severely affected. Whilst this weather
condition is in effect, no Pass actions or Throw Team-mate actions
can be performed, and no player can attempt to Rush.
Additionally, the referee has retreated indoors and isn't bothering to
even pretend they're keeping an eye on the action! Whilst this weather
condition is in effect, players cannot be Sent-off for committing a
Foul, even if they roll a natural double on either the Armour roll or
the Injury roll.
