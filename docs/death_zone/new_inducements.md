Blood Bowl is a sport that has captured the hearts and minds of an entire world. It is played from pole to pole, across many continents and in every climate imaginable. There are far more rules variations than can easily be covered within a single tome, and no end of ideas to explore in the future.

In addition to the common Inducements listed in the *Blood Bowl* rulebook, coaches may wish to use the ones detailed on the following pages. All of the Inducements that follow are balanced for use alongside the common Inducements, but are listed as optional extras so that the list of Inducements isn't too long and confusing.

The inclusion of these rules in a league or tournament is at the discretion of the league commissioner or tournament organiser. Otherwise, coaches who wish to use these rules for an exhibition game should decide this between themselves.

## 0-2 (IN)FAMOUS COACHING STAFF

**PRICE VARIES, AVAILABLE TO VARIOUS TEAMS**

Although most Blood Bowl celebrities are players, with the occasional ref thrown in for good measure, there are several well-known members of coaching staff around the circuit. From choreography directors for the cheerleading squad, to financial specialists who will deal with bribing the officials, there is almost no limit to the helpful hangers-on that linger around Blood Bowl stadia, hoping to find employment with a coach daft enough to believe their claims. Consequently, many a team will experiment with all manner of temporary coaching staff, hoping to get something useful from the deal.

However, and perhaps contrary to expectations, some of these specialist experts do actually have some useful knowledge to impart or skills to share. Many of these individuals have become minor celebrities in their own right in recent years, becoming regular interviewees on Cabalvision! Though it must be said, most such interviews only happen when the players themselves are refusing to speak to the press...

(In)Famous Coaching Staff are available to purchase during the pre-game sequence at the cost listed. You may purchase up to two (In)Famous Coaching Staff who are allowed to assist your team.

It is possible for both teams to hire the services of the same named (In)Famous Coaching Staff:

* If this happens during a game that is part of a league, neither team can use the (In)Famous Coaching Staff but the (In)Famous Coaching Staff will keep both hiring fees.
* If this happens during exhibition play, both teams can use the (In)Famous Coaching Staff one team has clearly hired a ringer!

**"IF YOU WANT A JOB DONE..."**

Kari counts as two Temp Agency Cheerleaders. In addition, if her team cannot set up 11 players at the start of a drive, Kari may decide to *"show 'em how it's done!".* Her team's coach can choose to set her up as part of the team. If they do so, she counts as part of the team for the duration of the drive, and no longer counts as two Temp Agency Cheerleaders. When the drive ends, Kari is Sent-off. You cannot Argue the Call or use a Bribe to prevent this. She will play no further part in the game she does not count as any Temp Agency Cheerleaders, and she cannot be used in a later drive.

**"BY THE POWER OF THE GODS!"**

At the start of each drive, after the teams have been set up but before the kick-off, Papa Skullbones can attempt to bless one player on his team (not a Mercenary or Star Player) with the power of the Chaos gods. Choose a player on your team from among those on the pitch, and roll a D8 on the table below. Any Skills gained are kept until the end of the drive; if the player already has both Skills, "*By the Power of the Gods!* has no effect on them. A player cannot be chosen if a roll has already been made for them during this game.

**"BY THE POWER OF THE GODS!"**

| D8 | RESULT |
| ------ | ---------- |
| **1**  | *Unworthy:* The player is struck down. The player is immediately removed from play and placed in the Knocked-out box of their team dugout. |
| **2**  | *Overlooked:* The chosen player is overlooked by the fickle gods. Randomly select another player from the same team, excluding players not on the pitch and players for whom a roll on this table has already been made, and roll on this table again. |

**"GO TEAM!"**

Each time Galandril's team rolls Cheering Fans on the Kick-off Event table, add D3 to the number of cheerleaders the team has if the team does not have any cheerleaders, it counts as having one. In addition, each time Galandril's team makes a roll on the Prayers to Nuffle table, if a natural 15 or 16 is rolled on the D16 (or, if a D8 is being rolled as in exhibition play, if a natural 8 is rolled), the team gains an additional team re-roll.

**70,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH THE 'UNDERWORLD CHALLENGE' SPECIAL RULE**

**"A NEW PLAYTHI... ER, PATIENT!"**

Once per game, during Step 2 of the End of Drive sequence, Krot can experiment on a player who has been removed from play as a Casualty, in an attempt to get them back out there. Choose a player that is in the Casualty box of Krot's team dugout (not a Mercenary or a Star Player). This may even be a player that has suffered a Casualty table result of 15-16, DEAD. Roll a D6 on the table opposite and apply the result to the chosen player:

**"A NEW PLAYTHI... ER, PATIENT!"**

| D6 | RESULT |
| ------ | ---------- |
| **1**  | **There Were... Complications:** The player's condition has worsened. The coach of the opposing team rolls on the Casualty table to determine exactly what has happened to the player. The result of this roll is applied immediately, in addition to any other Casualty table results already applied. Note that multiple Miss Next Game results do not stack. |
| **2-3**| **Useless Flesh-thing!** Krot's tinkering has no effect and the player remains in the Casualty box. |
| **4-5**| **Flawed Execution:** The player is returned to the Reserves box and can be set up with the rest of the team. However, until the end of the next drive, they gain the Really Stupid (4+) trait. If they already have the Really Stupid (4+) trait, it is replaced with the Really Stupid (5+) trait. At the end of this drive, the player is returned to the Casualty box, where the effects of the Casualty roll that was previously made against them are applied as normal. |
| **6**  | **Witness Perfection!** The player is returned to the Reserves box and can be set up with the rest of the team. At the end of this drive, the player is returned to the Casualty box, where the effects of the Casualty roll that was previously made against them are applied as normal. |

**"THIS KID HAS REAL POTENTIAL!"**

If your team took on any Journeymen during Step 3 of the pre-game sequence, Ayleen will ensure that they are the best, and all are eager to impress!

~~Roll a D6 for each, applying a -1 modifier to the roll for each Journeyman taken on~~ <span style="color: darkmagenta">Roll a D6 for each, applying a -1 modifier to the roll for each Journeyman taken on after the first:</span>

* On a roll of 1 or less, the Journeyman is a team player, but doesn't show any particular talent. The Journeyman loses the Loner (4+) trait.
* On a roll of 2‑5, the Journeyman has some potential. The Journeyman gains a single randomly selected Skill from one of their Primary skill categories.
* On a roll of 6, Ayleen has produced a player with real star quality! The Journeyman gains two randomly selected Skills from one of their Primary skill categories.

Each Journeyman counts towards CTV as normal; their value does not increase for any Skills they may have. Journeymen provided by Ayleen may be permanently hired during Step 4 of the post-game sequence as normal, but doing so will cost an additional 10,000 gold pieces per Skill.

Until the end of this game, each selected player gains a single randomly selected Skill from the Mutations category. However, at the start of Step 3 of the post-game sequence, roll a D6 for each of these players (unless they suffered, and did not recover from, a Casualty table result of 15-16, DEAD during the game):

* On a roll of 1, the experiment proves a bit of a failure, really. The player immediately loses the Skill. In addition, the player must miss the next game, exactly as if they had suffered a Casualty table result of 7-9, Seriously Hurt, during this game.
* On a roll of 2‑5, the experiment proved only a short-lived success. The player immediately loses the Skill.
* On a roll of 6, the professor's experiments have proven a total success! The player retains the Skill without having to spend any SPP (note that you must adjust their Current Value accordingly, as if the player had randomly selected a Secondary skill).

* On a roll of 1, the player's protestations fall upon deaf ears and Mungo 'treats' his patient. The player becomes a casualty and is immediately removed from play and placed in the Casualty box of their team dugout. No Casualty roll is made. Instead, a Badly Hurt result is automatically applied against them.
* On a roll of 2-4, the player is badly pummelled but suffers neither lasting harm nor noticeable benefit.. The player is removed from play and placed in the Knocked-out box of your team dugout as normal.
* On a roll of 5 or 6, the player regains their senses remarkably quickly and is able to fend off the ministrations of the Orc. The player remains on the pitch and becomes Stunned.

**"YOU GOT IT, BOSS!"**

Once per game, when your team uses a Bribe, you may re-roll the D6 to see if the Bribe is effective. In addition, when rolling on the Argue the Call table, a coach who has hired Fink treats a roll of 5 or 6 as a "*Well, When You Put It Like That..* result and a roll of 2-4 as an *"I Don't Care!"* result. However, on a "*You're Outta Here!* result, Fink is Sent-off along with the coach and will play no further part in the game.

### 0-1 (IN)FAMOUS COACHING STAFF INDUCEMENT: SCHIELUND SCHARLITAN

* On a roll of 2‑5, the agent simply drops the player from his books. They might be disappointed, but they'll get over it.
* On a roll of 6, the agent tires of his client and drops them, but the  exposure has been good for them. The player permanently retains the Pro skill without having to spend any SPP (note that you must adjust their Current Value accordingly, as if the player had chosen a Primary skill).

## 0-1 WIZARD

**PRICE VARIES, AVAILABLE TO VARIOUS TEAMS**

Over the years, Wizards in Blood Bowl have brought sports viewers more joy than almost any other form of outside interference, and the fans never tire of seeing their favourite stars turned into hopping amphibians or sticks of charcoal. It's hilarious!

Wizards, just like everybody else in the known world, are keen sports fans and many are fanatically loyal in support of their chosen team. It is hardly surprising that, in the early days of Blood Bowl, Wizards of all stripes would 'help out' the team they supported with carefully- selected spells. Soon, games were awash with magic as rival Wizards battled to give their team the edge. In the end, the Colleges of Magic were forced to step in at the NAF's request and insist that in order to have magical aid teams must have purchased, at an exorbitant fee to cover admin costs and handling, a special permit from the new governing body for such things (the Colleges of Magic, as it turned out). They limited this aid to one spell per match, and even this had to be chosen from a very limited spellbook and cast by an officially-appointed Colleges of Magic Sports-Wizard, whom in turn had to have a special license from the new governing body for such things (that's right, the Colleges of Magic!). Wizards and fans alike soon realised that what they really wanted to see was a proper Blood Bowl match rather than a spellcasting contest, so the new rules were soon universally accepted.

Today, Wizards of all types are drawn to Blood Bowl stadia on game day. From those belonging to the Arcane Colleges, to powerful Elven mages, Sorcerers and Shamans of Chaos, and even, in rare circumstances, the near-mythical Slann Mage-priests of Lustria. All find ready employment with the many Cabalvision networks, as it takes huge amounts of magical energy to capture the action and beam it globally to the crystal balls and magic mirrors of Cabalvision subscribers around the world.

Consequently, there are always Wizards to be found at any given fixture, card-carrying members of the Colleges of Magic, all more than happy to moonlight for a team wishing to secure their assistance.

No team may purchase more than one Wizard Inducement per game.

Some Wizards are named, although most are not. It is possible for both teams to hire the services of the same named Wizard:

* If this happens during a game that is part of a league, neither team can use the named Wizard but the named Wizard will keep both hiring fees.
* If this happens during exhibition play, both teams can use the named Wizard one team has clearly hired a ringer!

If a Wizard Inducement is not named, there is no restriction on both teams fielding the same type.

Any Standing players hit by the Fireball are Knocked Down. When a player is Knocked Down by a Fireball, you may apply a +1 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll. This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made.

**COLUMN OF FIRE**

~~You may cast this spell either at the start of any of the opposition's team turns, before any player is activated, or immediately after any of the opposition's team turns has ended.~~ <span style="color: darkmagenta">You may cast this spell at the end of either player's team turn, before the next team turn begins.</span> Choose any square that is adjacent to one of the Sidelines to be the Column of Fire's starting point.

* On a roll of 1-3, the player is able to duck and avoid the Column of Fire.

Any Standing players hit by the Column of Fire are Knocked Down. When a player is Knocked Down by the Column of Fire, you may apply a +1 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll. This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made.

## BIASED REFEREE INDUCEMENTS

In general, the members of the RARG that officiate over Blood Bowl games are unsung heroes of the sport. However, many referees have risen to the ranks of superstardom for their dedication to the rules, if not for their dedication to fair play! Whilst bribery is an established part of the culture of Blood Bowl (the RARG even dictates set rates and offers discounts for repeat, there are many referees willing to go the extra yard for a team with gold to share.

Biased Referees are available to purchase during the pre-game sequence at the cost listed, and because Blood Bowl games tend to be officiated over by a group rather than a single individual, both teams may purchase a Biased Referee. You may purchase one Biased Referee to treat your team favourably during the game ahead.

For the most part, a Biased Referee will treat both teams equally, meaning that they follow all of the normal referee rules as described in the *Blood Bowl* rulebook. Where they differ is that they will be either far more harsh in their scrutiny of the opposition or far more lenient in their treatment of the team that has paid them off. How this manifests is described in each Biased Referee's description.

Most Biased Referees are named, although some are not. As with Star Players, it is possible for both teams to hire the services of the same named Biased Referee:

* If this happens during a game that is part of a league, neither team can use the named Biased Referee but the named Biased Referee will keep both hiring fees.
* If this happens during exhibition play, both teams can use the named Biased Referee they can dish out harsh rulings to both sides!

### 0-1 BIASED REFEREE: RANULF 'RED' HOKULI

**130,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH EITHER THE 'LUSTRIAN SUPERLEAGUE' OR 'OLD WORLD CLASSIC' SPECIAL RULES**

**'RED' CARD**

When suitably remunerated, Ranulf will keep a particularly close eye on one of the teams. If any player on the opposing team commits a Foul but a double is not rolled when making either the Armour roll or Injury roll, roll a D6:

* On a roll of 4+, Ranulf loudly demands that play halt whilst he investigates further.
* On a roll of 1-3, the player manages to avoid the ref's attention.

Once spotted by Ranulf in this way (and only in this way), the coach of the player that committed the Foul must choose one of the following options:

* The coach may use a Bribe if one is available.
* The player that committed the Foul may accept their fate and be Sent-off.
* The player may attempt to argue with Ranulf! Ranulf will settle the argument with his axe. An Armour roll is made against the player, applying a +2 modifier to the result:

- If the roll is higher than the Armour Value of the player, they become Prone and an Injury roll is made against them. The player is not Sent-off and no Turnover is caused.
- If the roll is equal to or lower than the Armour Value of the player hit, the attack has no effect. The player is Sent-off and a Turnover caused.

**"I'M NOT ONE FOR ARGUING!"**

If Ranulf has been Induced for this game, even if he does not take part due to both coaches Inducing him, neither coach can Argue the Call even the most argumentative of coaches can't help but have respect for the charismatic Norscan.

### 0-1 BIASED REFEREE: THORON KORENSSON

**120,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH THE 'WORLDS EDGE SUPERLEAGUE' SPECIAL RULE**

**STRICT DISCIPLINE**

Korensson is renowned for bringing strict discipline to the pitch which, when questioned, is backed up with extremely tough penalties. If any player on the opposing team commits a Foul but a double is not rolled when making either the Armour roll or Injury roll, roll a D6:

* On a roll of 4+, Korensson has spotted the violation.
* On a roll of 1-3, the player manages to avoid the ref's attention.

Once spotted by Korensson in this way (and only in this way), the player that committed the Foul is immediately Sent-off. When a player is Sent-off in this way, their coach cannot use a Bribe but may attempt to Argue the Call. However, if a 1 is rolled on the Argue the Call table, not only is the player and the coach Sent-off, but one other randomly selected player belonging to the opposing team and that is currently on the pitch is Sent-off as well.

**"SIT DOWN AND KEEP QUIET!"**

If a Get the Ref result is rolled on the Kick-off Event table, roll again it takes a particularly riled-up crowd to want to advance on Korensson.

### 0-1 BIASED REFEREE: JORM THE OGRE

**120,000 GOLD PIECES (80,000 GOLD PIECES FOR TEAMS WITH THE 'BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION' SPECIAL RULE), AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM**

**JORM DOESN'T LIKE CHEATERS!**

Jorm is always on the lookout for dirty play, and misses very little. If any player on the opposing team commits a Foul but a double is not rolled when making either the Armour roll or Injury roll, roll a D6:

* On a roll of 4+, Jorm has spotted the cheat and rolls up his sleeves to deliver his own form of justice.
* On a roll of 1-3, the player manages to avoid the ref's attention.

Once spotted by Jorm in this way (and only in this way), the player that committed the Foul is immediately Knocked Down. When a player is Knocked Down by Jorm, you may apply a +1 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll. This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made.

**"SHUT IT, YOU HOOLIGANS!"**

If a Get the Ref result is rolled on the Kick-off Event table, the normal effects are ignored instead, Jorm goes into a rampage and starts tearing through the stands to teach the rowdy fans a lesson! Both teams reduce their Fan Factor for this game by -1 each time a Get the Ref result is rolled on the Kick-off Event table.

### 0-1 BIASED REFEREE: THE TRUNDLEFOOT

**TRIPLETS: BUNGO, FILIBERT AND JEPH 80,000 GOLD PIECES (40,000 GOLD PIECES FOR TEAMS WITH THE 'HALFLING THIMBLE CUP' SPECIAL RULE), AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM**

**HEAVY-HANDED INCOMPETENCE**

The Trundlefoot Triplets often try their best to partake in a bit of honest corruption, but all too often they fail. If any player on the opposing team commits a Foul but a double is not rolled when making either the Armour roll or Injury roll, roll a D6:

* On a roll of 5+, the player that committed the Foul is Sent-off, exactly as if they had rolled a double (i.e., the opposing coach may use a Bribe if one is available and may attempt to Argue the Call).
* On a roll of 2-4, the triplets, squabbling amongst themselves, miss the Foul.
* On a roll of 1, however, the victim of the Foul is Sent-off as if they had committed a Foul and rolled a double!

**"SMART PLAYERS ARE WELL-BEHAVED PLAYERS!"**

At the start of each drive, after both teams are set-up but before the kick-off, roll a D6. On a roll of 6, one randomly selected player on the opposing team that is not being Marked becomes embroiled in a pointless argument with the triplets about their kit. The player is immediately Placed Prone and becomes Stunned, representing the time wasted arguing.

**"THEY DON'T LOOK HAPPY!"**

If a Get the Ref result is rolled on the Kick-off Event table, the triplets make themselves scarce and will play no further part in this game. In addition, each team also gets a Bribe as normal.

## OTHER INDUCEMENTS

As well as powerful Wizards, notorious referees and renowned sideline staff, Blood Bowl teams often employ a wide variety of other methods to gain the upper hand. Be it strong ale to build up the fighting spirits of smaller players, to catapults that launch projectiles across the pitch, there seems to be no limit to the ingenuity shown by teams unwilling to accept the role of underdog in an important fixture!

**INDUCEMENTS IN LEAGUE PLAY**

As described in the *Blood Bowl* rulebook, during the pre- game sequence of a league fixture, each team can spend gold pieces either from their Treasury, from Petty Cash or both, to purchase any of the Inducements available to them which are then recorded on the team's Game Record sheet.

**INDUCEMENTS IN EXHIBITION PLAY**

When a team is drafted for exhibition play, you may spend as much or as little of your Team Draft Budget as you wish on Inducements, provided your team contains the minimum of 11 players, not including Induced Star Players. If you are drafting a team for exhibition play to be used at an event or tournament, you should pay close attention to the rulespack created by the organisers, as it is quite common that not all Inducements will be allowed. Also, it is common for tournament organisers to create their own, special Inducements.

If two coaches are drafting teams for exhibition play between themselves, they should take a few minutes to discuss Inducements first. It is important to decide if there are any Inducements they feel should be included or any they would prefer to leave out.

### 0-1 WAAAGH! DRUMMER

**50,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH THE 'BADLANDS BRAWL' SPECIAL RULE**

At the start of each drive, after the Kick-off event has been resolved but before the ball itself lands, roll 3D6. For each roll of a 4+, one player on the opposing team can be pushed back one square towards their own End Zone, exactly as if a Push Back block dice result had been applied against them. The same player can be pushed back more than once by this Inducement.

### 0-3 CAVORTING NURGLINGS

**30,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH THE 'FAVOURED OF NURGLE' SPECIAL RULE**

At the beginning of the game, a team may increase its Fan Factor by +1 for each swarm of Cavorting Nurglings it has Induced. In addition, for the duration of this game, a team may increase its number of cheerleaders by the number of Cavorting Nurglings Induced.

### 0-1 DWARFEN RUNESMITH

**50,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH EITHER THE 'OLD WORLD CLASSIC' OR 'WORLDS EDGE SUPERLEAGUE' SPECIAL RULES**

During each Start of Drive sequence, after Step 2 but before Step 3, you can select a single player on your team that is currently on the pitch that does not have the Loner (X+) trait and choose one of the following runes. Then roll a D6:

* On a roll of 4+, the rune takes effect, but you cannot attempt to use the Runesmith again at the start of a later drive.
* On a roll of 2 or 3, the rune does not work, but you can attempt to use the Runesmith again at the start of a later drive.
* On a roll of 1, the rune does not work, and you cannot attempt to use the Runesmith again at the start of a later drive.

**DWARFEN RUNES**

* **Rune of Might** Until the end of this drive, the chosen player gains the Mighty Blow (+1) skill. Rune of Fury Until the end of this drive, the chosen player gains both the Dauntless and Frenzy skills.

* **Rune of Speed** Until the end of this drive, the chosen player gains both the Sprint and Sure Feet skills.

* **Rune of Iron** Until the end of this drive, the chosen player's Armour Value is increased by 1 (to a maximum of 11+) and they gain the Stand Firm skill.

* **Rune of Impact** Until the end of this drive, the chosen player gains both the Juggernaut and Horns skills.

### 0-1 HALFLING HOT POT

**80,000 GOLD PIECES (60,000 GOLD PIECES FOR TEAMS WITH THE 'HALFLING THIMBLE CUP' SPECIAL RULE), AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH EITHER THE 'HALFLING THIMBLE CUP' OR 'OLD WORLD CLASSIC' SPECIAL RULES**

A Hot Pot can be used once per game, launching a cauldron of piping-hot stew onto the opposition. The Hot Pot may be used immediately after any of the opposition's team turns has ended. Choose a target square anywhere on the pitch and roll a D6:

* On a roll of 6, the shot is on target.
* On a roll of 2‑5, the shot is off target the target square is moved D3 squares in a direction determined by rolling a D8 and referring to the Random Direction template.
* On a roll of 1, something has gone horribly wrong and the Hot Pot has misfired in the team dugout. D3 randomly selected players in the Reserves box immediately become KO'd and moved to the Knocked- out box.

A player in the target square is automatically hit by the Hot Pot itself. If a Standing player is hit, they are Knocked Down. If a Prone or Stunned player is hit, an Armour roll is made against them. In either case, you may apply a +2 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll. This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made.

Additionally, roll a D6 for each Standing player (from either team) that is in a square adjacent to the target square:

* On a roll of 4+, the player has been hit by the mess of stew that showers out of the Hot Pot.
* On a roll of 1-3, the player manages to avoid being hit.

Any Standing player hit in this way is Placed Prone.

### 0-1 MASTER OF BALLISTICS

**40,000 GOLD PIECES (30,000 GOLD PIECES FOR TEAMS WITH THE 'HALFLING THIMBLE CUP' SPECIAL RULE), AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH EITHER THE 'HALFLING THIMBLE CUP' OR 'OLD WORLD CLASSIC' SPECIAL RULES**

During Step 2 of every Start of Drive sequence, the Master of Ballistics can attempt to advise the kicker. After placing the ball but before rolling for deviation, roll a D3 on the table opposite:

**MASTER OF BALLISTICS**

| D3 | Result                                                                                      |
|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | **Complete Misunderstanding:** The kicker has rather missed the point, and the kick-off deviates as normal. |
| 2  | **Interesting Theory...** The Master of Ballistics becomes side-tracked explaining the theory and runs out of time before the whistle. The distance the ball deviates is reduced by one square, from D6 squares to D6-1 squares (meaning there is a chance it won't deviate at all if a 1 is rolled). |
| 3  | **Successful Practical Application:** By Nuffle, the kicker's grasped it! After rolling the dice for deviation, the kicking team's coach can choose to modify the roll of either the D6 or the D8 by +1 or +2, or -1 or -2 as they wish, to a minimum of 1, and a maximum of 6 (for the D6) and 8 (for the D8). |

### 0-3 BOTTLES OF HEADY BREW

**40,000 GOLD PIECES EACH, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM BELONGING TO TIER 3**

At the start of a drive, after both teams have been set up but before the kick-off (between Step 1 and Step 2), randomly select D3 players with the Stunty trait that are currently set up on the pitch. For the remainder of this drive, those players gain the Dauntless and Frenzy skills and the Really Stupid (4+) trait.

### 0-1 TEAM MASCOT

**30,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM**

A team that includes a Team Mascot gains an extra team re-roll (a suitable model should be placed on your team re- roll tracker). However, to use the Team Mascot re-roll you must first roll a D6:

* On a roll of 1-4, the Team Mascot proves ineffective and, pelted by food wrappers and worse, retreats to the locker room. The Team Mascot re-roll is lost for this half of the game. However, you may use a normal team re-roll instead.
* On a roll of 5+, the Team Mascot re-roll can be used, just like a normal team re-roll.

### 0-1 MEDICINAL UNGUENT

**60,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM**

Should a player on your team be removed from play having suffered a 10-12, Serious Injury result on the Casualty table, after any other attempts to heal that player have been made and have failed, you may use this Inducement. The player is immediately removed from the Casualty box and placed in the Reserves box of your dugout, having been miraculously healed by the liberal application of something that smells extremely suspicious. However, at the end of this game, the result of the Casualty roll is applied as normal.

### 0-1 SIDE BET

**PRICE VARIES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM**

After Step 4, but before Step 5 of the pre-game sequence, you may place a bet of between 10,000 and 100,000 gold pieces that your team will win the game. Simply inform your opponent that the bet has been placed, and how much you are betting. Should your team win the game, you will receive double your stake back during Step 1 of the post-game sequence (for example, if you bet 20,000 gold pieces that your team would win, you will win 40,000 gold pieces if it does win).

If, however, your team loses, the stake is lost (such is the risk of gambling)!
