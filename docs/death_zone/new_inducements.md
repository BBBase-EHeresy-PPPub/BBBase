Blood Bowl is a sport that has captured the hearts and minds of an entire world. It is played from pole to pole, across many continents and in every climate imaginable. There are far more rules variations than can easily be covered within a single tome, and no end of ideas to explore in the future.

In addition to the common Inducements listed in the *Blood Bowl* rulebook, coaches may wish to use the ones detailed on the following pages. All of the Inducements that follow are balanced for use alongside the common Inducements, but are listed as optional extras so that the list of Inducements isn't too long and confusing.

The inclusion of these rules in a league or tournament is at the discretion of the league commissioner or tournament organiser. Otherwise, coaches who wish to use these rules for an exhibition game should decide this between themselves.

## 0-2 (IN)FAMOUS COACHING STAFF

**PRICE VARIES, AVAILABLE TO VARIOUS TEAMS**

Although most Blood Bowl celebrities are players, with the occasional ref thrown in for good measure, there are several well-known members of coaching staff around the circuit. From choreography directors for the cheerleading squad, to financial specialists who will deal with bribing the officialss, there is almost no limit to the helpful hangers-on that linger around Blood Bowl stadia, hoping to find employment with a coach daft enough to believe their claims. Consequently, many a team will experiment with all
manner of temporary coaching staff, hoping to get something useful from the deal.

However, and perhaps contrary to expectations, some of these specialist experts do actually have some useful knowledge to impart or skills to share. Many of these individuals have become minor celebrities in their own right in recent years, becoming regular interviewees on Cabalvision! Though it must be said, most such interviews only happen when the players themselves are refusing to speak to the press...

(In)Famous Coaching Staff are available to purchase during the pre-game sequence at the cost listed. You may purchase up to two (In)Famous Coaching Staff who are allowed to assist your team.

It is possible for both teams to hire the services of the same named (In)Famous Coaching Staff:

* If this happens during a game that is part of a league, neither team can use the (In)Famous Coaching Staff but the (In)Famous Coaching Staff will keep both hiring fees.
* If this happens during exhibition play, both teams can use the (In)Famous Coaching Staff one team has clearly hired a ringer!

### 0-1 (IN)FAMOUS COACHING STAFF INDUCEMENT: KARI COLDSTEEL

**50,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH EITHER THE 'ELVEN KINGDOMS LEAGUE', 'LUSTRIAN SUPERLEAGUE', 'OLD WORLD CLASSIC' OR 'WORLDS EDGE SUPERLEAGUE' SPECIAL RULES**

*One of the most well-known games of 2477 was between the Asgard Ravens and the Lowdown Rats. The Ravens players, who were taking part in the ongoing strikes over a salary dispute, refused to leave the dugout at the start of play. Their head coach was close to despair - the team was having a bad season already and conceding the game was out of the question. In desperation, he turned to the team's cheerleading squad, who were more than happy to take to the pitch for a change. History was made that day, and they achieved an impressively-bloody 3-1 victory, sending over half of the Rats to the casualty box.*

*Although the cheerleaders returned to their normal duties after the game, several of them got a taste for playing, none more so than Kari Coldsteel. She tendered her resignation the same day, then spent the next decade playing for a number of minor league teams. In 2491 she retired from active play and returned to cheerleading, letting out her services to teams whose squads might be in need of a little encouragement. Of course, no one ever truly retires from Blood Bowl, and she has been known to step in and help out her team if they're losing. The refs don't seem to mind - and neither do the fans!*

**"IF YOU WANT A JOB DONE..."**

Kari counts as two Temp Agency Cheerleaders. In addition, if her team cannot set up 11 players at the start of a drive, Kari may decide to *"show 'em how it's done!".* Her team's coach can choose to set her up as part of the team. If they do so, she counts as part of the team for the duration of the drive, and no longer counts as two Temp Agency Cheerleaders. When the drive ends, Kari is Sent-off. You cannot Argue the Call or use a Bribe to prevent this. She will play no further part in the game she does not count as any Temp Agency Cheerleaders, and she cannot be used in a later drive.

### 0-1 (IN)FAMOUS COACHING STAFF INDUCEMENT: PAPA SKULLBONES

**80,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH EITHER THE 'FAV0URED OF...' OR 'UNDERWORLD CHALLENGE' SPECIAL RULES**

*Although the official religion of Blood Bowl is Nufflismm, any number of other (arguably lesser) gods are worshipped by its many and diverse players, officialss and fans. Followers of the Chaos gods, in particular, seem drawn to the sport - it must be something to do with the non-stop bloodshed and the fans' ritualistic chanting!*

*Any number of so-called Shamans are active on the circuit at one time, offering their services to teams who require guidance, but few are as successful as Papa Skullbones. The secret to his success, the thing that sets him apart from so many of his contemporaries, is simple: showmanship! From his larger-than-life attire to the spine-tingling rumble of his voice, his entire persona has been expertly crafted to convey the sort of otherworldly gravitas that is expected of a priest of the Dark Gods. He gets results, too; as well as making impressive pre-game displays, his rituals do indeed seem to attract the gods' attention, and a blessing from Papa Skullbones is often enough to ensure a team's success.*

**"BY THE POWER OF THE GODS!"**

At the start of each drive, after the teams have been set up but before the kick-off, Papa Skullbones can attempt to bless one player on his team (not a Mercenary or Star Player) with the power of the Chaos gods. Choose a player on your team from among those on the pitch, and roll a D8 on the table below. Any Skills gained are kept until the end of the drive; if the player already has both Skills, "*By the Power of the Gods!* has no effect on them. A player cannot be chosen if a roll has already been made for them during this game.

**"BY THE POWER OF THE GODS!"**

**D8 RESULT**

1. ***Unworthy:*** The player is struck down. The player is immediately removed from play and placed in the Knocked-out box of their team dugout.
2. ***Overlooked:*** The chosen player is overlooked by the fickle gods. Randomly select another player from the same team, excluding players not on the pitch and players for whom a roll on this table has already been made, and roll on this table again.
3. ***Freakish Proportions:*** The player gains the Big Hand and Very Long Legs skills.
4. ***Grasping Tendrils:*** The player gains the Tentacles and Prehensile Tail skills.
5. ***Horrific Visage:*** The player gains the Disturbing Presence and Foul Appearance skills.
6. ***Grisly Bifurcation:*** The player gains the Extra Arms and Two Heads skills.
7. ***Thorny Protrusions:*** The player gains the Claws and Horns skills.
8. ***Favour of the Gods:*** The player gains two Skills of your choice, chosen from the Mutations category.

### 0-1 (IN)FAMOUS COACHING STAFF INDUCEMENT: GALANDRIL SILVERWATER

**40,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH THE 'ELVEN KINGD0MS LEAGUE' SPECIAL RULE**

*For several decades, there has been one name regarded above all others in the field of cheerleading: Galandril Silverwater. From lowly beginnings as an assistant seamstress for the Tiranoc Titans, she gradually advanced through a number of supporting roles until she was recruited to the team's cheerleading squad in 2448 and became an overnight sensation.*

*The following decades were a whirlwind of fame and fortune for Galandril; as well as being an exceptionally- talented dancer, overfloowing with charisma, she had a small amount of innate magical ability which she put to use in creating breathtaking half-time displays. She changed teams a few times until she accepted a long- term contract with the Elfheim Eagles for an incredible sum of money - more than most professional players, let alone cheerleaders. In 2487, she decided to step back from front-line duties ("leave that to the two-hundred year olds," she quipped in a Spike! Magazine interview) to spend more time working on her ongoing series of memoirs. She still makes her services available to teams whose cheer squads could use a little extra pep, but it's clear that she does it for the love of the sport rather than the money - after all, it's rumoured that she has enough squirrelled away to buy out the Blood Bowl tournament five times over!*

**"GO TEAM!"**

Each time Galandril's team rolls Cheering Fans on the Kick-off Event table, add D3 to the number of cheerleaders the team has if the team does not have any cheerleaders, it counts as having one. In addition, each time Galandril's team makes a roll on the Prayers to Nuffle table, if a natural 15 or 16 is rolled on the D16 (or, if a D8 is being rolled as in exhibition play, if a natural 8 is rolled), the team gains an additional team re-roll.

### 0-1 (IN)FAMOUS COACHING STAFF INDUCEMENT: KR0T SH0CKWHISKER

**70,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH THE 'UNDERWORLD CHALLENGE' SPECIAL RULE**

*Although many perceive Skaven to be little more than a horde of verminous pests, their culture has many merits. While there is no doubt that they are vicious, cannibalistic and spiteful, they are also masters of engineering and flesh-crafting, to a degree that other races could not hope to achieve.*

*Entire clans dedicate themselves to the singular pursuit of advancement in these fields, and their work - while often grotesque and terrifying - shows undeniable genius. Krot Shockwhisker is particularly skilled in the melding of flesh and technology, having spent many years studying and replicating the best of his peers' creations. To financce his experiments, he offers his services to teams who do not ask questions. Fallen players are brought to his specially-equipped corner of the dugout, and he sets to work..*

**"A NEW PLAYTHI... ER, PATIENT!"**

Once per game, during Step 2 of the End of Drive sequence, Krot can experiment on a player who has been removed from play as a Casualty, in an attempt to get them back out there. Choose a player that is in the Casualty box of Krot's team dugout (not a Mercenary or a Star Player). This may even be a player that has suffered a Casualty table result of 15-16, DEAD. Roll a D6 on the table opposite and apply the result to the chosen player:

**"A NEW PLAYTHI... ER, PATIENT!"**

**D6 RESULT**

**1. *There Were.. Complications:*** The player's condition has worsened. The coach of the opposing team rolls on the Casualty table to determine exactly what has happened to
the player. The result of this roll is applied immediately, in addition to any other Casualty table results already applied. Note that multiple Miss Next Game results do not stack.

**2-3 *Useless Flesh-thing!*** Krot's tinkering has no effect and the player remains in the Casualty box.

**4-5 *Flawed Execution:*** The player is returned to the Reserves box and can be set up with the rest of the team. However, until the end of the next drive, they gain the Really Stupid (4+) trait. If they already have the Really Stupid (4+) trait, it is replaced with the Really Stupid (5+) trait. At the end of this drive, the player is returned to the Casualty box, where the effects of the Casualty roll that was previously made against them are applied as normal.

**6 *Witness Perfection!*** The player is returned to the Reserves box and can be set up with the rest of the team. At the end of this drive, the player is returned to the Casualty box, where the effects of the Casualty roll that was previously made against them are applied as normal.

### 0-1 (IN)FAMOUS COACHING STAFF INDUCEMENT: AYLEEN ANDAR

**100,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM**

*Talent scouts have become a major part of modern Blood Bowl. These expert assessors of rookie talent travel the world far and wide, sometimes in packs, seeking out those young players that show the most ability and hoping to snap them up on behalf of their employer before an unscrupulous agent does!*

*Ayleen Andar is a talent scout of particular note and in high demand with coaches and team owners alike. Ayleen scours the Old World from end to end, tracking down only the best young players. In her time, she's found some of the most renowned players on the circuit and given them their big break. True, talent scouts travel a lot and have to witness some truly terrible Blood Bowl being played, but as Ayleen always says: "Claiming one's expenses back from the client more than makes up for it!"*

**"THIS KID HAS REAL POTENTIAL!"**

If your team took on any Journeymen during Step 3 of the pre-game sequence, Ayleen will ensure that they are the best, and all are eager to impress!

Roll a D6 for each, applying a -1 modifier to the roll for each Journeyman taken on:

* On a roll of 1 or less, the Journeyman is a team player, but doesn't show any particular talent. The Journeyman loses the Loner (4+) trait.
* On a roll of 2-5, the Journeyman has some potential. The Journeyman gains a single randomly selected Skill from one of their Primary skill categories.
* On a roll of 6, Ayleen has produced a player with real star quality! The Journeyman gains two randomly selected Skills from one of their Primary skill categories.

Each Journeyman counts towards CTV as normal; their value does not increase for any Skills they may have. Journeymen provided by Ayleen may be permanently hired during Step 4 of the post-game sequence as normal, but doing so will cost an additional 10,000 gold pieces per Skill.

### 0-1 (IN)FAMOUS COACHING STAFF INDUCEMENT: PROFESSOR FRÖNKELHEIM

**130,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH THE 'SYLVANIAN SPOTLIGHT' SPECIAL RULE**

*Where most Necromancers are quiet and reserved sorts who enjoy nothing more than rooting around in graveyards and mausoleums looking for raw materials on which to practice their craft, some are distinctly larger-than-life characters who just seem destined to attract attention and controversy!*

*Professor Frdnkelheim is such a character. Formerly a lecturer at the University of Altdorf, the good professor has been hounded out of more towns ahead of an angry, torch-wielding mob than a Halflinng has had hot dinners. A student of anatomy, Frdnkelheim gained notoriety for his experiments in performance-enhancing surgery. Believing he could use the discarded parts of deceased players to improve others, Frönkelheim soon discovered that the people of the Empire weren't so keen on such strange science. Having his laboratory burned down led the professor to suspect that ordinary people lacked vision. Having another two dozen or so burned down since then has made him certain! These days, Frdnkelheim resides somewhere in Sylvania, where the locals are more accepting of his peculiar ways, and funds his research by.. modifying players for local Blood Bowl teams.*

**"HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT AN UPGRADE?"**

During the pre-game sequence, after Step 4 but before Step 5, randomly select D3 players on your team that are eligible to play during this game. These players have been modifiedd by the professor.

Until the end of this game, each selected player gains a single randomly selected Skill from the Mutations category. However, at the start of Step 3 of the post-game sequence, roll a D6 for each of these players (unless they suffered, and did not recover from, a Casualty table result of 15-16, DEAD during the game):

* On a roll of 1, the experiment proves a bit of a failure, really. The player immediately loses the Skill. In addition, the player must miss the next game, exactly as if they had suffered a Casualty table result of 7-9, Seriously Hurt, during this game.
* On a roll of 2-5, the experiment proved only a short-lived success. The player immediately loses the Skill.
* On a roll of 6, the professor's experiments have proven a total success! The player retains the Skill without having to spend any SPP (note that you must adjust their Current Value accordingly, as if the player had randomly selected a Secondary skill).

### 0-1 (IN)FAMOUS COACHING STAFF INDUCEMENT: MUNGO SPINECRACKER

**80,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH EITHER THE 'BADLANDS BRAWL', 'OLD WORLD CLASSIC' OR 'UNDERWORLD CHALLENGE' SPECIAL RULES**

*Sports physiotherapy is a relatively new science in the world of Blood Bowl, though calling such a brutal practice a 'science' might be stretching the meaning of the word to breaking point, which, coincidentally, is a rather fine description of what practitioners do to their patients! The practice was developed, almost by accident, in the  Badlands by Orcs who found that many injuries involving dislocated joints could be fixed with the application of brute force. In fact, the mere threat of carefully-applied brutality was found to be a wonderful motivator for all but the most hopelessly unconscious of players. The threat of being ministered to by a trained expert in physical terror can make most common ailments simply disappear!*

*Mungo Spinecracker is a renowned expert in the field, an Orc that has honed his natural ability to inflicct pain on a body to an art form. Amongst Mungo's most well-known and feared techniques are numerous moves that would be more at home in a wrestling match than a sick bay. But it is Mungo's patented 'firrm sports massage' that most terrifiees his patients. Mungo is always quick to defend his methods, of course, claiming that savagely punching and kicking a prone patient "gets da blood pumpin'", and that, should the gurney collapse, the sudden shock "rebalances da humours"!*

**"I'M FINE THANKS, MUNGO!"**

Whenever a player on your team suffers an Injury result of 8-9, KO'd (or of 7-8, KO'd on the Stunty Injury table), you may roll a D6 before removing them from play:

* On a roll of 1, the player's protestations fall upon deaf ears and Mungo 'treats' his patient. The player becomes a casualty and is immediately removed from play and placed in the Casualty box of their team dugout. No Casualty roll is made. Instead, a Badly Hurt result is automatically applied against them.
* On a roll of 2-4, the player is badly pummelled but suffers neither lasting harm nor noticeable benefit.. The player is removed from play and placed in the Knocked-out box of your team dugout as normal.
* On a roll of 5 or 6, the player regains their senses remarkably quickly and is able to fend off the ministrations of the Orc. The player remains on the pitch and becomes Stunned.

### 0-1 (IN)FAMOUS COACHING STAFF INDUCEMENT: FINK DA FIXER

**90,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH EITHER THE 'BADLANDS BRAWL' OR 'UNDERWORLD CHALLENGE' SPECIAL RULES**

*Goblins are renowned for their sneaky, devious behaviour but, every once in a while, one will rise to prominence who makes the rest of them look as slow-witted as Trolls by comparison. Fink da Fixer was never the tallest or quickest, but wherever he went, he was the most quick- witted Goblin around. He started his Blood Bowl career playing with the Thunder Valley Greenskins, but was promoted to assistant coach when his shrewd grasp of tactics was noticed by head coach, Frugg One-eye.*

*It wasn't long before he was practically running the team, and then only a matter of time before he outgrew the Greenskins. He set himself up as an independent contractor, and the rest is history! Now he can be found on the sidelines in all corners of the circuit, clipboard in hand, making sure the rest of the coaching staff have everything they need a few seconds before they need it, greasing the palms of the officialss and generally making himself indispensable.*

**"YOU GOT IT, BOSS!"**

Once per game, when your team uses a Bribe, you may re-roll the D6 to see if the Bribe is effective. In addition, when rolling on the Argue the Call table, a coach who has hired Fink treats a roll of 5 or 6 as a "*Well, When You Put It Like That..* result and a roll of 2-4 as an *"I Don't Care!"* result. However, on a "*You're Outta Here!* result, Fink is Sent-off along with the coach and will play no further part in the game.

### 0-1 (IN)FAMOUS COACHING STAFF INDUCEMENT: SCHIELUND SCHARLITAN

**90,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM**

*Player agents are an essential, if unpopular, part of the game; everybody needs them, but no one particularly wants them. Most players recognise the importance of having a good agent to secure them a fair contract, but resent paying them a 15% cut of their salary. Most head coaches and team owners recognise the value in a good agent who keeps their players happy and feeds their egos, but find it hard to discipline an egotistical player whose agent knows how to terminate their contract!*

*Schielund Scharlitan is one of the most well-known agents in all the Old World, a decidedly greasy individual renowned for his ruthless ability to latch onto even the most talentless of players. Scharlitan is an expert at manipulating the press, building his clients' egos to the point they believe they have the makings of a superstar, even when they display no discernible talent! Such interest often does wonders for a player's self-belief. Sadly for most of his clients, he tires very quickly of players, and more than a few have found themselves struck from his books and tied into an unbreakable contract with a head coach who suddenly and inexplicably wants to make their lives a misery!*

**"I'LL MAKE YOU A STAR!"**

During the pre-game sequence, after Step 4 but before Step 5, randomly select D3 players on your team that are eligible to play during this game. These players have been approached by Scharlitan, and his interest is having a noticeable effect on their attitude!

Until the end of this game, each selected player gains the Pro skill. However, at the start of Step 3 of the post-game sequence, roll a D6 for each of these players (unless they suffered, and did not recover from, a Casualty table result of 15-16, DEAD during the game):

* On a roll of 1, that player has begun to act like they are the next big thing. The agent tires of his client and drops them, but the exposure has gone to their head. The player gains the Loner (2+) trait.
* On a roll of 2-5, the agent simply drops the player from his books. They might be disappointed, but they'll get over it.
* On a roll of 6, the agent tires of his client and drops them, but the   exposure has been good for them. The player permanently retains the Pro skill without having to spend any SPP (note that you must adjust their Current Value accordingly, as if the player had chosen a Primary skill).

## 0-1 WIZARD

**PRICE VARIES, AVAILABLE TO VARI0US TEAMS**

Over the years, Wizards in Blood Bowl have brought sports viewers more joy than almost any other form of outside interference, and the fans never tire of seeing their favourite stars turned into hopping amphibians or sticks of charcoal. It's hilarious!

Wizards, just like everybody else in the known world, are keen sports fans and many are fanatically loyal in support of their chosen team. It is hardly surprising that, in the early days of Blood Bowl, Wizards of all stripes would 'help out' the team they supported with carefully- selected spells. Soon, games were awash with magic as rival  Wizards battled to give their team the edge. In the end, the Colleges of Magic were forced to step in at the NAF's request and insist that in order to have magical aid teams must have purchased, at an exorbitant fee to cover admin costs and handling, a special permit from the new governing body for such things (the Colleges of Magic, as it turned out). They limited this aid to one spell per match, and even this had to be chosen from a very limited spellbook and cast by an officialy-appointed Colleges of Magic Sports-Wizard, whom in turn had to have a special license from the new governing body for such things (that's right, the Colleges of Magic!). Wizards and fans alike soon realised that what they really wanted to see was a proper Blood Bowl match rather than a spellcasting contest, so the new rules were soon universally accepted.

Today, Wizards of all types are drawn to Blood Bowl stadia on game day. From those belonging to the Arcane Colleges, to powerful Elven mages, Sorcerers and Shamans of Chaos, and even, in rare circumstances, the near-mythical Slann Mage-priests of Lustria. All find ready employment with the many Cabalvision networks, as it takes huge amounts of magical energy to capture the action and beam it globally to the crystal balls and magic mirrors of Cabalvision subscribers around the world.

Consequently, there are always Wizards to be found at any given fixtture, card-carrying members of the Colleges of Magic, all more than happy to moonlight for a team wishing to secure their assistance.

No team may purchase more than one Wizard Inducement per game.

Some Wizards are named, although most are not. It is possible for both teams to hire the services of the same named Wizard:

* If this happens during a game that is part of a league, neither team can use the named Wizard but the named Wizard will keep both hiring fees.
* If this happens during exhibition play, both teams can use the named Wizard one team has clearly hired a ringer!

If a Wizard Inducement is not named, there is no restriction on both teams fielding the same type.

### 0-1 WIZARD INDUCEMENT: CHAOS SORCERER

**150,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH EITHER THE 'FAV0URED OF...' OR 'UNDERWORLD CHALLENGE' SPECIAL RULES**

*The Sorcerers of Chaos are potent spell-slingers who manipulate the raw stuff of magic to their will. There is little subtlety about their craft, and it can be as devastating and destructive as it can be ficckle. Such masters of Dark Magic can be found in all the tribes of the north, and readily answer the call of their Dark Gods to accompany Chaotic teams in their adventures in Blood Bowl. What separates these Sorcerers from the mages of the south is that their power is instinctual, a gift given by their gods rather than an art carefully studied and managed. This can lead to some unexpectedly amusing spell effects when things go wrong and, as a result, Chaos Sorcerers are ever popular with the fans who love nothing more than to see a player turned into something very odd mid-game.*

Once per game, a Chaos Sorcerer may cast one of the following spells:

**THUNDERBOLT**
You may cast this spell either at the start of any of the opposition's team turns, before any player is activated, or immediately after any of the opposition's team turns has ended. Target any Standing opposition player anywhere on the pitch, and roll a D6:

* On a roll of 3+, the player has been hit by the Thunderbolt.
* On a roll of 1 or 2, the player manages to duck or dodge the attack.

A Standing player hit by a Thunderbolt is Knocked Down. When a player is Knocked Down by a Thunderbolt, you may apply a +1 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll. This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made.

**RAMPANT MUTATION**
You may cast this spell at the start of any of the opposition's team turns. Choose a player on your team from among those on the pitch, and roll a D6:

* On a roll of 2+, until the end of this drive that player gains two Mutation skills of your choice.
* On a roll of 1, the player becomes a writhing mass of flesh as raw chaos energy floows through them momentarily. The player gains the Disturbing Presence skill until the end of this drive.

### 0-1 WIZARD INDUCEMENT: DRUCHII SPORTS SORCERESS

**150,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH EITHER THE 'ELVEN KINGD0MS LEAGUE' OR 'FAV0URED OF...' SPECIAL RULES**

*The Dark Elves are a race steeped in magic, yet the vast majority of Dark Elf magic users are female, belonging to an ancient cabal founded by the infamous mother of the Druchii king. Rumour has it that the dark arts practiced by these potent mages are actually derived from the favour of the Chaos god Slaanesh, granting their power a far more sinister nature than the wholesome high magic practiced by the Wizards of Ulthuan. Whatever the source of their magical might, the Dark Elves have never been shy to use it to their benefitt on the Blood Bowl pitch, be it within the tight guidelines laid down by the Colleges of Magic, or in more subtle, underhanded ways such as the micro-spells the Darkside Cowboys are reported to utilise.*

Once per game, a Druchii Sports Sorceress may cast one of the following spells:

**THUNDERBOLT**

You may cast this spell either at the start of any of the opposition's team turns, before any player is activated, or immediately after any of the opposition's team turns has ended. Target any Standing opposition player anywhere on the pitch, and roll a D6:

* On a roll of 3+, the player has been hit by the Thunderbolt.
* On a roll of 1 or 2, the player manages to duck or dodge the attack.

A Standing player hit by a Thunderbolt is Knocked Down. When a player is Knocked Down by a Thunderbolt, you may apply a +1 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll. This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made.

**ONE THOUSAND CUTS**

You may cast this spell at the start of any of the opposition's team turns, before any player is activated. Target any opposition player anywhere on the pitch, and roll a D6:

* On a roll of 3+, the player is hit by a swirling storm of incorporeal dark magic.
* On a roll of 1 or 2, the magic engulfs the player brieflyy before the spell dissipates harmlessly.

Until the end of this drive, the MA, ST, and AG characteristics of a player hit by One Thousand Cuts are reduced by 1.

### 0-1 WIZARD INDUCEMENT: ASUR HIGH MAGE

**150,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH THE 'ELVEN KINGD0MS LEAGUE' SPECIAL RULE**

*The mages of Ulthuan are among the most accomplished of magic users in the entire known world. Noble and proud, like all Elven kind, Asur mages spend many decades and centuries studying their craft. Where the magic wielders of other races will often focus their endeavours upon mastering one of the eight winds of magic that floow around the world, High Elf mages study the discipline of each in equal measure. The art of High Magic, as it is known, is difficcult beyond imagining, and more than one young apprentice has managed to accidentally flicck their brain out of their ear when trying to balance the potent energies that course through their bodies! Such disciplined mages rarely waste their valuable time following Blood Bowl, but that's not to say that there aren't those who do!*

Once per game, an Asur High Mage may cast one of the following spells:

**TEMPORAL DISTORTION**

You may cast this spell immediately after any of the opposition's team turns has ended. Magical energy fillss the stadium, causing the passage of time to slow down or speed up as the High Mage wishes.

You may attempt to move both teams' turn markers forwards or backwards one space, effectively causing both teams to gain an extra turn this half or lose one of the remaining turns. Both turn markers must move in the same direction. Declare whether you wish to move the turn markers forwards one space or backwards one space and roll a D6:

* On a roll of 5+, the spell is successful and the turn markers are moved.
* On a roll of 1-4, the stadium fillss with light and the strangely localised effects cause the High Mage to rapidly age or become unexpectedly more youthful, but otherwise the spell has no effect.

**THUNDERBOLT**

You may cast this spell either at the start of any of the opposition's team turns, before any player is activated, or immediately after any of the opposition's team turns has ended. Target any Standing opposition player anywhere on the pitch, and roll a D6:

* On a roll of 3+, the player has been hit by the Thunderbolt.
* On a roll of 1 or 2, the player manages to duck or dodge the attack.

A Standing player hit by a Thunderbolt is Knocked Down. When a player is Knocked Down by a Thunderbolt, you may apply a +1 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll. This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made.

### 0-1 WIZARD INDUCEMENT: SLANN MAGE-PRIEST

**200,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH THE 'LUSTRIAN SUPERLEAGUE' SPECIAL RULE**

*Servants of the near-mythical Old Ones, Slann Mage- priests are among the most ancient creatures in the known world and are easily the greatest magic users in all of existence. Legend tells that at the dawn of time, the Slann served their masters, shaping the world to suit their purposes, raising entire mountain ranges and levelling others, moving continents, even bringing the very world closer to the sun. Nothing was beyond the power of the Slann! Today, however, they sleep through the long aeons, waking only rarely to ensure their masters' plans are followed or to check upon their favourite team's performance! Rarely is a Slann seen at pitch side, and when they are they often sleep through the whole game. Yet this torpor does little to limit the influencce these most potent of mages can have as, even dreaming, they can alter the shape of reality!*

Once per game, a Slann Mage-priest may cast one of the following spells:

**TEMPORAL DISTORTION**

You may cast this spell immediately after any of the opposition's team turns has ended. Magical energy fillss the stadium, causing the passage of time to slow down or speed up as the Mage-priest wishes.

You may attempt to move both teams' turn markers forwards or backwards one space, effectively causing both teams to gain an extra turn this half or lose one of the remaining turns. Both turn markers must move in the same direction. Declare whether you wish to move the turn markers forwards one space or backwards one space and roll a D6:

* On a roll of 5+, the spell is successful and the turn markers are moved.
* On a roll of 1-4, the stadium fillss with light and the strangely localised effects cause the Mage-priest to suddenly develop a few more warts and wrinkles, but otherwise the spell has no effect.

**TECTONIC SHIFT**

You may cast this spell at the start of any of the opposition's team turns, before any player is activated. For the duration of this team turn, there is a -1 modifier applied to the dice roll every time an opposition player attempts to Rush.

Note that this modifier applies alongside any other modifiers that apply to attempts to Rush.

**REALITY BLINKS**

You may cast this spell either at the start of any of the opposition's team turns, before any player is activated, or immediately after any of the opposition's team turns has ended. Choose two Standing players from your team that do not have the Loner (X+) trait and that are not in possession of the ball from among those on the pitch, and roll a D6:

* On a roll of 3+, these two players immediately switch places.
* On a roll of 1 or 2, the players become slightly transparent as they waver between realities! Until the start of your next team turn, these two players lose their Tackle Zone and gain the No Hands trait.

### 0-1 WIZARD INDUCEMENT: HORTICULTURALIST OF NURGLE

**150,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH EITHER THE 'FAV0URED OF NURGLE' OR 'UNDERWORLD CHALLENGE' SPECIAL RULES**

*Wherever Nurgle's followers travel, a gruesome flourrishing of fresh life follows, be it squirming, maggoty worms or the vigorous growth of strange florra. Stadia dedicated to Nurgle are particularly worrisome, for even as the walls and stands decay, the pitch writhes with life, the soil churning and bulging as peculiar plants burst forth, before rotting away in a moment. It is not uncommon for the Horticulturalists who tend these pitches to travel with their teams, spreading their knowledge to other grounds and bringing with them the seeds of Nurgle's garden to sow in the mortal world. Such fellows, jolly though they are, are unpopular with the groundsmen of the Old World, and many times various bodies have attempted to impose strict rules that would prevent their interference!*

Once per game, a Horticulturalist of Nurgle may cast one of the following spells:

**VIGOROUS GROWTH**

You may cast this spell at the start of any of the opposition's team turns, before any player is activated. For the duration of this team turn, there is a -2 modifier applied to the dice roll every time an opposition player attempts to Rush.

Note that this modifier applies alongside any other modifiers that apply to attempts to Rush.

**STRANGE FLORA**

You may cast this spell either at the start of any of the opposition's team turns, before any player is activated, or immediately after any of the opposition's team turns has ended. Choose an empty target square anywhere on the pitch and nominate D3 Standing opposition players that are within two squares of the target square. Roll a D6 for each nominated player:

* On a roll of 3+, the player is unexpectedly attacked by daemonic plants of prodigious size that erupt from the loamy earth before rapidly rotting away to nothing.
* On a roll of 1 or 2, the player manages to duck and avoid the attacking florra.

Any Standing players hit by Strange Flora are Knocked Down. When a player is Knocked Down by Strange Flora, you may apply a +1 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll. This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made.

### 0-1 WIZARD INDUCEMENT: SPORTS NECROTHEURGE

**150,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH THE 'SYLVANIAN SP0TLIGHT' SPECIAL RULE**

*Not all practitioners of dark magic are inclined to run their own teams. A great many prefer the steady wages and stress-free work offered by the various Cabalvision networks, pursuing their own interests in their spare time (everyone needs a hobby). In these more enlightened times, Necromancers are also far more welcome within the various Colleges of Magic, enabling them to offer their services to coaches in need as hireling Wizards. Due to their singular and all-consuming passions though, they tend to stick to what they know and, rather than hurling firreballs, are usually hired to coax a bit of extra potency from the players!*

Once per game, a Sports Necrotheurge may cast one of the following spells:

**INCORPOREAL**
You may cast this spell at the start of any of the opposition's team turns, before any player is activated. Target any Standing opposition player anywhere on the pitch, and roll a D6:

* On a roll of 3+, the player is hit and becomes strangely incorporeal!
* On a roll of 1 or 2, the player brieflyy becomes eerily luminous, before the spell dissipates harmlessly.

A player hit by Incorporeal gains the No Hands trait and, if they are in possession of the ball, will immediately drop it, causing it to bounce. Additionally, the player loses their Tackle Zone. The effects of Incorporeal last until the start of the opposition's next team turn.

**VANHALABLE'S DANSE MACABRE**

You may cast this spell immediately after any of the opposition's team turns has ended. Roll a D6:

* On a roll of 3+, your players are suffused with dark vitality. During   this team turn, each Lineman positional player on your team that is currently on the pitch (including Journeymen) may improve either their MA, AG or PA by 1. You may choose which of these three bonuses each affected player gains when that player is activated.
* On a roll of 1 or 2, the sky darkens and the players jerk and spasm furiously, but the spell has no further effect.

### 0-1 WIZARD INDUCEMENT: WICKED WITCH

**150,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH EITHER THE 'OLD WORLD CLASSIC', 'SYLVANIAN SPOTLIGHT' OR 'UNDERWORLD CHALLENGE' SPECIAL RULES**

*Wizards are a common sight all across the Old World, and most belong to one of the many Colleges of Magic (even Necromancers have come out of the shadows in recent years), but Witches remain somewhat more elusive. Witches don't belong to any formal College or guild, and rarely express much interest in working for a Cabalvision network. Instead they practice a more spiritual, naturalistic form of magic, often referred to as 'hedge magic' by their magical peers within the Colleges. Most small towns and villages are home to one or more Witches, who normally make a comfortable living selling magical cures to those maladies that commonly afflicct people living in small towns, such as plagues of warts. What many don't realise is that these Witches are powerful magic users that deal in potent curses and many, varied types of hex. All too often, the ailment the local Witch is asked to cure is one that has been visited upon the sufferer by the Witch herself!*

Once per game, a Wicked Witch may cast one of the following spells:

**ZAP!**

You may cast this spell either at the start of any of the opposition's team turns, before any player is activated, or immediately after any of the opposition's team turns has ended. Target any opposition player and roll a D6:

* If the roll is equal to or higher than the player's Strength characteristic, or is a natural 6, that player turns into a Frog for the remainder of the drive, after which their coach will secure emergency magical assistance to turn the player back into their original form.
* If the roll is lower than the player's Strength characteristic, the player develops a fresh crop of warts, but the spell has no further effect.

If the player was in possession of the ball when they were turned into a Frog, it is dropped and will bounce. When a roll on the Casualty table is required against the Frog, no roll is made. Instead, it is automatically treated as if a 1-6, Badly Hurt result had been rolled. The Frog must miss the rest of the game and cannot be patched-up by an apothecary (because it's a frog!). At the end of the game, the player is returned to their normal shape with no ill effects.

The Frog has the following profile:

|      | MA | ST | AG | PA | AV |
| ---- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Frog | 5  | 1  | 2+ | -  | 5+ |

Skills & Traits Dodge, Leap, No Hands, Stunty, Titchy, Very Long Legs

**PLAGUE OF WARTS**

You may cast this spell at the start of any of the opposition's team turns, before any player is activated. Target any opposition player anywhere on the pitch, and roll a D6:

* On a roll of 3+, the player is hit and their skin unexpectedly erupts into a mass of warts.
* On a roll of 1 or 2, the player develops a few unsightly blemishes, but is otherwise unaffected.

Until the end of this drive, the MA, ST, and AG characteristics of a player hit by Plague of Warts are reduced by 1. Additionally, until the end of this drive, a player hit by Plague of Warts gains the Disturbing Presence and Foul Appearance skills.

### 0-1 WIZARD INDUCEMENT: WARLOCK ENGINEER
**150,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH THE 'UNDERWORLD CHALLENGE' SPECIAL RULE** 

*Warlock Engineers are Skaven that have mastered the dark art of warpstone technology, utilising the unstable (and extremely dangerous) stuff of raw chaos to create the many strange and dangerous technologies their scurrying kind rely on for the eternal expansion of their underground realm (it is also often used as a food source amongst the wealthier members of Skaven society, which might explain the number of mutations many well-to-do Skaven display with pride!). Usually, one of the first things any aspiring Warlock Engineer learns is how to create and manipulate warp lightning. This crackling, greenish energy represents the unbridled power of pure chaos set loose upon the world, and is used as both the basis and the fuel for most of the Skaven's contraptions, but unleashed in its raw form it can deliver a nasty shock!*

Once per game, a Warlock Engineer may cast one of the following spells:

**WARP LIGHTNING**

You may cast this spell either at the start of any of the opposition's team turns, before any player is activated, or immediately after any of the opposition's team turns has ended. Choose any square that is adjacent to one of the Sidelines to be the Warp Lightning's starting point. The Warp Lightning follows a path from one Sideline to the other, moving in a straight line from its starting point directly towards the opposite Sideline. Roll a D6 for every Standing player (from either team) that occupies a square in the Warp Lightning's path:

* On a roll of 3+, the player has been hit by the Warp Lightning.

* On a roll of 1 or 2, the player is lucky and the bolt zips overhead.

Any Standing players hit by the Warp Lightning are Knocked Down. When a player is Knocked Down by Warp Lightning, you may apply a +1 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll. This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made.

Finally, when a player is Knocked Down by Warp Lightning, roll a D6. On a roll of 1, the Warp Lightning is earthed through the player. Do not roll to see if any more players are hit. On a roll of 2+, the Warp Lightning continues along its path, as described above.

**THUNDERBOLT**

You may cast this spell either at the start of any of the opposition's team turns, before any player is activated, or immediately after any of the opposition's team turns has ended. Target any Standing opposition player anywhere on the pitch, and roll a D6:

* On a roll of 3+, the player has been hit by the Thunderbolt.

* On a roll of 1 or 2, the player manages to duck or dodge the attack.

A Standing player hit by a Thunderbolt is Knocked Down. When a player is Knocked Down by a Thunderbolt, you may apply a +1 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll. This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made. 

### 0-1 WIZARD INDUCEMENT: OGRE FIREBELLY 
**150,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH THE 'BADLANDS BRAWL' SPECIAL RULE**

*While many races find it appropriate to place their Wizards and priests in stuffy colleges and rely on eccentric old coots to teach them, Ogres take a more fleexible approach. For a Firebelly, this is a trial by firre which involves eating fiery spices, eating fiery beetles and, finally, eating the fiery lava of the Fire Mouth volcano (an Ogre's imagination is clearly not so hot!). Those few who survive become wandering barbeque chefs and many find ready employment at Blood Bowl stadia. Such individuals can easily be convinced to stand on the sidelines spitting hot firre across the pitch, and woe betide anyone that gets in the way!*

Once per game, a Firebelly may cast one of the following spells:

**FIREBALL**

You may cast this spell either at the start of any of the opposition's team turns, before any player is activated, or immediately after any of the opposition's team turns has ended. Choose a target square anywhere on the pitch and roll a D6 for each Standing player (from either team) that occupies either the target square or a square adjacent
to it:

* On a roll of 4+, the player has been hit by the Fireball.
* On a roll of 1-3, the player manages to avoid the Fireball.

Any Standing players hit by the Fireball are Knocked Down. When a player is Knocked Down by a Fireball, you may apply a +1 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll. This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made.

**COLUMN OF FIRE**

You may cast this spell either at the start of any of the opposition's team turns, before any player is activated, or immediately after any of the opposition's team turns has ended. Choose any square that is adjacent to one of the Sidelines to be the Column of Fire's starting point. The Column of Fire follows a path from one Sideline to the other, moving in a straight line from its starting point directly towards the opposite Sideline. Roll a D6 for every Standing player (from either team) that occupies a square in the Column of Fire's path:

* On a roll of 4+, the player has been hit by the Column of Fire.

* On a roll of 1-3, the player is able to duck and avoid the Column of Fire.

Any Standing players hit by the Column of Fire are Knocked Down. When a player is Knocked Down by the Column of Fire, you may apply a +1 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll. This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made.

### 0-1 WIZARD INDUCEMENT: NIGHT GOBLIN SHAMAN
**150,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH EITHER THE 'BADLANDS BRAWL' OR 'UNDERWORLD CHALLENGE' SPECIAL RULES**

*To many races of the world, the difference between a Goblin and a Night Goblin comes down solely to their fashion choices. However, there are distinct differences between the two, with Night Goblins being more prone to consuming large quantities of fungi as part of their strange rituals. On the sidelines of the Blood Bowl pitch, a Night Goblin Shaman will spend their time much as they do anywhere else; experimentally brewing fungus beer and consuming their various concoctions until they find just the right mix. At that moment, they will unleash their full power, enhanced by their beverage, upon unwitting players; most of the time, this happens to be the opposition.*

Once per game, a Night Goblin Shaman may cast one of the following spells:

**FOOT OF GORK (OR MORK)**

You may cast this spell at the start of any of the opposition's team turns, before any player is activated. Target any Standing opposition player anywhere on the pitch, and roll a D6:

* On a roll of 6, the player has been kicked by the Foot of Gork (or Mork)!

* On a roll of 3-5, the player has been stomped on by the Foot of Gork (or Mork).

* On a roll of 1 or 2, the player is lucky and the Foot of Gork (or Mork) swings harmlessly over their head.

A Standing player kicked by the Foot of Gork (or Mork) is immediately catapulted through the air. 

Immediately treat that player as being thrown (as if they had the Right Stuff trait, and as if their Strength is 3 or less should their Strength be 4 or more) by another player (with the Throw Team-mate trait and a Strength of 5 or more), and treat the quality of the throw as terrible.

A Standing player stomped on by the Foot of Gork (or Mork) is Knocked Down. When a player is Knocked Down by the Foot of Gork (or Mork), you may apply a +1 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll. This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made. 

**SPORE CLOUD**

You may cast this spell at the start of any of the opposition's team turns, before any player is activated. Target any Standing opposition player anywhere on the pitch, and roll a D6: 

* On a roll of 2+, the player is engulfed by a cloud of Madcap Mushroom spores. Until the end of this drive, the player gains both the Loner (5+) and Really Stupid traits.

* On a roll of 1, the player begins to sprout strange fungus from their armour, before the spell dissipates harmlessly.

### 0-1 NAMED WIZARD INDUCEMENT: HORATIO X. SCHOTTENHEIM, MASTER MAGE

**80,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM**

*In the history of Blood Bowl, there have been any number of great Wizards. Unfortunately, Horatio X. Schottenheim is unlikely to ever be counted among their number, but that doesn't make him any less popular! Obsessed with the quest for fame and glory, Horatio has devoted his life to becoming Blood Bowl's premier spellcaster.*

*He's spent millions of crowns on advertising, he's gone out of his way to always make himself available for hire at the drop of a hat, and he's even managed to secure a regular column in Spike! Magazine.. but greatness still lingers ever-so-slightly out of his reach. The truth of the matter is this: he just isn't very good at magic. After several years of mishaps and near-death experiences, he has stopped trying to learn new spells, dedicating himself instead to creating the perfect firreball. One day, he may even manage it.*

Once per game, Horatio may cast the following spell:

**"TAKE THIS! OOOPS..."**

Horatio conjures up a firreball spell and flinngs it with his legendarily poor aim in the general direction of the action on the pitch. Horatio may cast this spell either at the start of any of the opposition's team turns, before any player is activated, or immediately after any of the opposition's team turns has ended. Choose a target square anywhere on the pitch. The target square is moved D3 squares in a direction determined by rolling a D8 and referring to the Random Direction template. After moving the target square, roll a D6 for each Standing player (from either team) that is either in the target square or a square adjacent to it:

* On a roll of 4+, the player has been hit by the Fireball.
* On a roll of 1-3, the player manages to avoid the Fireball.

Any Standing players hit by the Fireball are Knocked Down. When a player is Knocked Down by a Fireball, you may apply a +1 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll. This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made.

## BIASED REFEREE INDUCEMENTS

In general, the members of the RARG that officiate over Blood Bowl games are unsung heroes of the sport. However, many referees have risen to the ranks of superstardom for their dedication to the rules, if not for their dedication to fair play! Whilst bribery is an established part of the culture of Blood Bowl (the RARG even dictates set rates and offers discounts for repeat, there are many referees willing to go the extra yard for a team with gold to share.

Biased Referees are available to purchase during the pre-game sequence at the cost listed, and because Blood Bowl games tend to be officiated over by a group rather than a single individual, both teams may purchase a Biased Referee. You may purchase one Biased Referee to treat your team favourably during the game ahead.

For the most part, a Biased Referee will treat both teams equally, meaning that they follow all of the normal referee rules as described in the *Blood Bowl* rulebook. Where they differ is that they will be either far more harsh in their scrutiny of the opposition or far more lenient in their treatment of the team that has paid them off. How this manifests is described in each Biased Referee's description.

Most Biased Referees are named, although some are not. As with Star Players, it is possible for both teams to hire the services of the same named Biased Referee:

* If this happens during a game that is part of a league, neither team can use the named Biased Referee but the named Biased Referee will keep both hiring fees.

* If this happens during exhibition play, both teams can use the named Biased Referee they can dish out harsh rulings to both sides!


## 0-1 BIASED REFEREE: RANULF 'RED' HOKULI 
**130,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH EITHER THE 'LUSTRIAN SUPERLEAGUE' OR 'OLD WORLD CLASSIC' SPECIAL RULES** 

*A strapping Norseman with floowing hair, a sculpted physique and a voice loud enough to be heard over the largest crowd, Hokuli divides his time between leading raids on small villages and officiaating Blood Bowl games. He’s often joked that he can’t tell which one’s more dangerous! Thankfully, the fans never hold his pillaging against him (even those who have been recent targets of one of his raids), thanks, in no small part, to his matchless charisma and his reputation as one of the most honourable and even-handed refs on the circuit. In fact, Hokuli’s word is so well-regarded by players that he’s only rarely had to use his battleaxe on the pitch!*

**'RED' CARD**

When suitably remunerated, Ranulf will keep a particularly close eye on one of the teams. If any player on the opposing team commits a Foul but a double is not rolled when making either the Armour roll or Injury roll, roll a D6:

* On a roll of 4+, Ranulf loudly demands that play halt whilst he investigates further.

* On a roll of 1-3, the player manages to avoid the ref's attention.

Once spotted by Ranulf in this way (and only in this way), the coach of the player that committed the Foul must choose one of the following options:

* The coach may use a Bribe if one is available.

* The player that committed the Foul may accept their fate and be Sent-off.

* The player may attempt to argue with Ranulf! Ranulf will settle the argument with his axe. An Armour roll is made against the player, applying a +2 modifier to the result:

- If the roll is higher than the Armour Value of the player, they become Prone and an Injury roll is made against them. The player is not Sent-off and no Turnover is caused.

- If the roll is equal to or lower than the Armour Value of the player hit, the attack has no effect. The player is Sent-off and a Turnover caused.

**"I'M NOT ONE FOR ARGUING!"**

If Ranulf has been Induced for this game, even if he does not take part due to both coaches Inducing him, neither coach can Argue the Call even the most argumentative of coaches can't help but have respect for the charismatic Norscan.

### 0-1 BIASED REFEREE: THORON KORENSSON
**120,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH THE 'WORLDS EDGE SUPERLEAGUE' SPECIAL RULE**

*One of the longest-serving officialss in Blood Bowl, Korensson of Zorn Uzkul was one of Roze-El's original apprentices. He's stayed meticulously up-to-date with the rules and has famously never made a bad call. Many a head coach has tried to argue with him over the years, only to be met with granite-faced silence and a glower that could melt  gromril as Korensson's tightly- curled black beard bristles with barely-suppressed rage. To this day, Korensson's broad figure and tall hat command instant respect from players and fans alike!*

**STRICT DISCIPLINE**

Korensson is renowned for bringing strict discipline to the pitch which, when questioned, is backed up with extremely tough penalties. If any player on the opposing team commits a Foul but a double is not rolled when making either the Armour roll or Injury roll, roll a D6:

* On a roll of 4+, Korensson has spotted the violation.

* On a roll of 1-3, the player manages to avoid the ref's attention.

Once spotted by Korensson in this way (and only in this way), the player that committed the Foul is immediately Sent-off. When a player is Sent-off in this way, their coach cannot use a Bribe but may attempt to Argue the Call. However, if a 1 is rolled on the Argue the Call table, not only is the player and the coach Sent-off, but one other randomly selected player belonging to the opposing team and that is currently on the pitch is Sent-off as well.

**"SIT DOWN AND KEEP QUIET!"**

If a Get the Ref result is rolled on the Kick-off Event table, roll again it takes a particularly riled-up crowd to want to advance on Korensson.

### 0-1 BIASED REFEREE: J0RM THE 0GRE 
120,000 G0LD PIECES (80,000 G0LD PIECES F0R TEAMS WITH THE ‘BRIBERY AND C0RRUPTI0N’ SPECIAL RULE), AVAILABLE T0 ANY TEAM

*Several seasons ago, the Society Against the Stereotyping of Ogres ran a campaign that spanned billboards, programmes and even Cabalvision ad breaks, seeking to overcome the cliche that the average Ogre is a mindless creature. Their champion was an Ogre called Jorm, who applied to the RARG Training Programme in the hope of becoming a referee. He passed with flyinng colours but, in hindsight, this was probably due to political spin rather than any aptitude on his part because, if anything, Jorm has proved the cliche to be entirely correct. Jorm has become notorious for his single-minded dislike of cheaters and his very straightforward approach to dealing with them. Often, this approach has extended to over-excited fans, with Jorm often taking it upon himself to assert order upon the stands!*

**JORM D0ESN'T LIKE CHEATERS!**

Jorm is always on the lookout for dirty play, and misses very little. If any player on the opposing team commits a Foul but a double is not rolled when making either the Armour roll or Injury roll, roll a D6:

* On a roll of 4+, Jorm has spotted the cheat and rolls up his sleeves to deliver his own form of justice.

* On a roll of 1-3, the player manages to avoid the ref's attention.

Once spotted by Jorm in this way (and only in this way), the player that committed the Foul is immediately Knocked Down. When a player is Knocked Down by Jorm, you may apply a +1 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll. This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made.

**"SHUT IT, YOU H00LIGANS!"**

*If a Get the Ref result is rolled on the Kick-off Event table, the normal effects are ignored instead, Jorm goes into a rampage and starts tearing through the stands to teach the rowdy fans a lesson! Both teams reduce their Fan Factor for this game by -1 each time a Get the Ref result is rolled on the Kick-off Event table.*

## 0-1 BIASED REFEREE: THE TRUNDLEF00T

**TRIPLETS: BUNGO, FILIBERT AND JEPH 80,000 GOLD PIECES (40,000 GOLD PIECES FOR TEAMS WITH THE 'HALFLING THIMBLE CUP' SPECIAL RULE), AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM**

*There are quite a number of officialss at a Blood Bowl game: sideline officialss, scorekeepers, drive timers, and so on, but there is usually only a single referee. One notable exception is the Trundlefoot Triplets, a trio of Halflinng brothers who work together to officiate.. in theory. In practice, they're a total shambles - they argue amongst themselves, disagree over the most obvious calls, and often get in the way of play. Jeph is arguably the worst, generally seen as one of the most incompetent referees of all time, and guilty of accidentally injuring players on several occasions.*

**HEAVY-HANDED INC0MPETENCE**

The Trundlefoot Triplets often try their best to partake in a bit of honest corruption, but all too often they fail. If any player on the opposing team commits a Foul but a double is not rolled when making either the Armour roll or Injury roll, roll a D6:

* On a roll of 5+, the player that committed the Foul is Sent-off, exactly as if they had rolled a double (i.e., the opposing coach may use a Bribe if one is available and may attempt to Argue the Call).

* On a roll of 2-4, the triplets, squabbling amongst themselves, miss the Foul.

* On a roll of 1, however, the victim of the Foul is Sent-off as if they had committed a Foul and rolled a double!

**"SMART PLAYERS ARE WELL-BEHAVED PLAYERS!"**

At the start of each drive, after both teams are set-up but before the kick-off, roll a D6. On a roll of 6, one randomly selected player on the opposing team that is not being Marked becomes embroiled in a pointless argument with the triplets about their kit. The player is immediately Placed Prone and becomes Stunned, representing the time wasted arguing.

**"THEY DON'T L00K HAPPY!"**

If a Get the Ref result is rolled on the Kick-off Event table, the triplets make themselves scarce and will play no further part in this game. In addition, each team also gets a Bribe as normal.

## OTHER INDUCEMENTS

As well as powerful Wizards, notorious referees and renowned sideline staff, Blood Bowl teams often employ a wide variety of other methods to gain the upper hand. Be it strong ale to build up the fighting spirits of smaller players, to catapults that launch projectiles across the pitch, there seems to be no limit to the ingenuity shown by teams unwilling to accept the role of underdog in an important fixture!

**INDUCEMENTS IN LEAGUE PLAY**

As described in the *Blood Bowl* rulebook, during the pre- game sequence of a league fixtture, each team can spend gold pieces either from their Treasury, from Petty Cash or both, to purchase any of the Inducements available to them which are then recorded on the team's Game Record sheet.

**INDUCEMENTS IN EXHIBITION PLAY**

When a team is drafted for exhibition play, you may spend as much or as little of your Team Draft Budget as you wish on Inducements, provided your team contains the minimum of 11 players, not including Induced Star Players. If you are drafting a team for exhibition play to be used at an event or tournament, you should pay close attention to the rulespack created by the organisers, as it is quite common that not all Inducements will be allowed. Also, it is common for tournament organisers to create their own, special Inducements.

If two coaches are drafting teams for exhibition play between themselves, they should take a few minutes to discuss Inducements first. It is important to decide if there are any Inducements they feel should be included or any they would prefer to leave out.

### 0-1 WAAAGH! DRUMMER
**50,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH THE 'BADLANDS BRAWL' SPECIAL RULE**

*Orcs live to figght, and a long tradition is that they have marched to battle to the sound of a menacing drumbeat. This not only keeps the lads moving in the right direction, it can also be downright terrifying for the other side! Many teams have begun to introduce the same idea to Blood Bowl games, in the hope of replicating this effect.*

At the start of each drive, after the Kick-off event has been resolved but before the ball itself lands, roll 3D6. For each roll of a 4+, one player on the opposing team can be pushed back one square towards their own End Zone, exactly as if a Push Back block dice result had been applied against them. The same player can be pushed back more than once by this Inducement.

### 0-3 CAVORTING NURGLINGS
**30,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH THE 'FAV0URED OF NURGLE' SPECIAL RULE**

*It is most common for the followers of Nurgle to be accompanied by swarms of Nurglings, tiny, daemonic representations of Nurgle himself that appear strangely able to project themselves into the mortal realm in great numbers wherever the Plague Father's followers tread. These mischievous sprites cause no end of trouble wherever Nurgle teams appear. Their antics have a huge appeal to the fans of the game, who delight in their morbid, slapstick comedy on the sidelines and their constant interference with officialss and opposition teams.*

At the beginning of the game, a team may increase its Fan Factor by +1 for each swarm of Cavorting Nurglings it has Induced. In addition, for the duration of this game, a team may increase its number of cheerleaders by the number of Cavorting Nurglings Induced.

### 0-1 DWARFEN RUNESMITH
**50,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH EITHER THE 'OLD WORLD CLASSIC' OR 'WORLDS EDGE SUPERLEAGUE' SPECIAL RULES**

*Runesmithing is the closest Dwarfs come to using magic. None of this airy-fairy, wave-your-hands-in-the-air nonsense for Dwarfs - Runesmiths work with hammer and anvil, beating enchanted sigils into a player's armour between drives.*

During each Start of Drive sequence, after Step 2 but before Step 3, you can select a single player on your team that is currently on the pitch that does not have the Loner (X+) trait and choose one of the following runes. Then roll a D6:

* On a roll of 4+, the rune takes effect, but you cannot attempt to use the Runesmith again at the start of a later drive. 

* On a roll of 2 or 3, the rune does not work, but you can attempt to use the Runesmith again at the start of a later drive.

* On a roll of 1, the rune does not work, and you cannot attempt to use the Runesmith again at the start of a later drive.

**DWARFEN RUNES**

**Rune of Might** Until the end of this drive, the chosen player gains the Mighty Blow (+1) skill. Rune of Fury Until the end of this drive, the chosen player gains both the Dauntless and Frenzy skills. 

**Rune of Speed** Until the end of this drive, the chosen player gains both the Sprint and Sure Feet skills.

**Rune of Iron** Until the end of this drive, the chosen player's Armour Value is increased by 1 (to a maximum of 11+) and they gain the Stand Firm skill.

**Rune of Impact** Until the end of this drive, the chosen player gains both the Juggernaut and Horns skills.

### 0-1 HALFLING H0T P0T
**80,000 GOLD PIECES (60,000 GOLD PIECES FOR TEAMS WITH THE 'HALFLING THIMBLE CUP' SPECIAL RULE), AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH EITHER THE 'HALFLING THIMBLE CUP' OR 'OLD WORLD CLASSIC' SPECIAL RULES**

*Once a desperate measure, the Halflinng Hot Pot is something of a mainstay among Moot militias. The Hot Pot is exactly that, a cauldron of boiling soup or stew, catapulted from a primitive, wooden frame towards a foe. The contents can cause significcant inconvenience, but for anyone unfortunate enough to be hit by the cauldron itself, the effects can be quite terminal!*

A Hot Pot can be used once per game, launching a cauldron of piping-hot stew onto the opposition. The Hot Pot may be used immediately after any of the opposition's team turns has ended. Choose a target square anywhere on the pitch and roll a D6:

* On a roll of 6, the shot is on target.

* On a roll of 2-5, the shot is off target the target square is moved D3 squares in a direction determined by rolling a D8 and referring to the Random Direction template.

* On a roll of 1, something has gone horribly wrong and the Hot Pot has misfirred in the team dugout. D3 randomly selected players in the Reserves box immediately become KO'd and moved to the Knocked- out box.

A player in the target square is automatically hit by the Hot Pot itself. If a Standing player is hit, they are Knocked Down. If a Prone or Stunned player is hit, an Armour roll is made against them. In either case, you may apply a +2 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll. This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made.

Additionally, roll a D6 for each Standing player (from either team) that is in a square adjacent to the target square: 

* On a roll of 4+, the player has been hit by the mess of stew that showers out of the Hot Pot.

* On a roll of 1-3, the player manages to avoid being hit. 

Any Standing player hit in this way is Placed Prone.

## 0-1 MASTER OF BALLISTICS
**40,000 GOLD PIECES (30,000 GOLD PIECES FOR TEAMS WITH THE 'HALFLING THIMBLE CUP' SPECIAL RULE), AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM WITH EITHER THE 'HALFLING THIMBLE CUP' OR 'OLD WORLD CLASSIC' SPECIAL RULES**

*The Empire, the largest human realm of the Old World, has a long history of wondrous invention, its master gunsmiths and engineers creating many fabulous examples of their art and ingenuity. The armies of the Emperor are home to huge battalions of artillery pieces, and the gunnery schools of the various states and provinces produce large numbers of skilled artillerymen and ballistics experts. A popular pastime amongst these soot-stained academics is the study of the art of ball tossing, and there is no shortage of those who claim to be able to improve a team's passing game through the careful application of scientificc principles. Results do vary..*

During Step 2 of every Start of Drive sequence, the Master of Ballistics can attempt to advise the kicker. After placing the ball but before rolling for deviation, roll a D3 on the table opposite:

**MASTER OF BALLISTICS**

**D3 RESULT**

**1 *Complete Misunderstanding:*** The kicker has rather missed the point, and the kick-off deviates as normal.

**2 *Interesting Theory...*** The Master of Ballistics becomes side-tracked explaining the theory and runs out of time before the whistle. The distance the ball deviates is reduced by one square, from D6 squares to D6-1 squares (meaning there is a chance it won't deviate at all if a 1 is rolled).

**3 *Successful Practical Application:*** By Nuffle, the kicker's grasped it! After rolling the dice for deviation, the kicking team's coach can choose to modify the roll of either the D6 or the D8 by +1 or +2, or -1 or -2 as they wish, to a minimum of 1, and a maximum of 6 (for the D6) and 8 (for the D8).

### 0-3 B0TTLES OF HEADY BREW
**40,000 GOLD PIECES EACH, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM BELONGING TO TIER 3**

*Halflinngs enjoy a fine ale every bit as much as they enjoy fine food, so it is only natural that within the Moot brewing ale is a big business. Many of these Halflinng ales are particularly potent and prone to making their more diminutive drinkers uncharacteristically figghty and troublesome! It is not uncommon for 'Stunty' Blood Bowl players to be dosed with a bottle before kick-off by a wily coach. The effect this can have on them is pretty extreme!*

At the start of a drive, after both teams have been set up but before the kick-off (between Step 1 and Step 2), randomly select D3 players with the Stunty trait that are currently set up on the pitch. For the remainder of this drive, those players gain the Dauntless and Frenzy skills and the Really Stupid (4+) trait.

### 0-1 TEAM MASCOT
**30,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM**

*In some regions, team mascots are incredibly popular. The fans delight to see one of their number take to the pitch alongside their beloved team, often dressed head-to- toe in a most amusing outfitt! Given free rein to show their support through the medium of outrageous dance and hilarious slapstick comedy, their antics on the sidelines entertain fans and players alike, often bringing some much-needed luck!*

*In other regions, such displays of total idiocy are frowned upon.*

A team that includes a Team Mascot gains an extra team re-roll (a suitable model should be placed on your team re- roll tracker). However, to use the Team Mascot re-roll you must first roll a D6:

* On a roll of 1-4, the Team Mascot proves ineffective and, pelted by food wrappers and worse, retreats to the locker room. The Team Mascot re-roll is lost for this half of the game. However, you may use a normal team re-roll instead.

* On a roll of 5+, the Team Mascot re-roll can be used, just like a normal team re-roll.

### 0-1 MEDICINAL UNGUENT
**60,000 GOLD PIECES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM**

*Losing players mid-game is a fact of Blood Bowl; injuries happen! But it isn't ideal, and a team that is short on players is a team at a serious disadvantage! There really is no limit to the things a head coach will try in order to keep their players on their feet and playing the game; from numbing Cold One slime to lessen the pain, to madcap mushrooms to lessen the player's awareness of the pain, and worse things besides, it's all been tried and most of it is legal! Sure, sometimes a player with an injured leg might lose it after the game, but this is often a risk the coach is willing to take (it isn't their leg, after all)!*

Should a player on your team be removed from play having suffered a 10-12, Serious Injury result on the Casualty table, after any other attempts to heal that player have been made and have failed, you may use this Inducement. The player is immediately removed from the Casualty box and placed in the Reserves box of your dugout, having been miraculously healed by the liberal application of something that smells extremely suspicious. However, at the end of this game, the result of the Casualty roll is applied as normal.

### 0-1 SIDE BET
**PRICE VARIES, AVAILABLE TO ANY TEAM**

*Betting on Blood Bowl is a popular pastime, and one that everyone joins in with. Most betting is conducted amongst the fans and players, and even team owners and head coaches also enjoy a little fluttter. Sadly, most bookmakers look down on sports insiders such as players and coaches betting on the outcome of their own games; they argue that it's too easy for them to influencce the result! Such protestations usually fall on deaf ears though, and the boldest of coaches think nothing of placing a small bet, especially when the gold pieces they're betting were given freely by the stadium owners to cover expenses; that's literally free money, right?*

After Step 4, but before Step 5 of the pre-game sequence, you may place a bet of between 10,000 and 100,000 gold pieces that your team will win the game. Simply inform your opponent that the bet has been placed, and how much you are betting. Should your team win the game, you will receive double your stake back during Step 1 of the post-game sequence (for example, if you bet 20,000 gold pieces that your team would win, you will win 40,000 gold pieces if it does win).

If, however, your team loses, the stake is lost (such is the risk of gambling)!
