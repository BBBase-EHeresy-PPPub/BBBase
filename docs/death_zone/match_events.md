Match Events are a great way to add some unexpected situations to Blood Bowl games. Unlike Special Play cards, they are triggered at random during the match, and neither coach knows which Match Event will be triggered until it comes into play.

Match Events are not recommended for events such as tournaments, or during the play-off season of a league, as they can greatly unbalance the action in favour of one team over the other. As with any other optional rule, they should only be used if both players agree that they should be. In league play, the league commissioner should decide whether Match Events are in use; adding them will bring a lot of fun and flavour, but they can make games unpredictable. In other words, some coaches will love them, others might not! The best way to find out is to try out a few games with Match Events and see for yourself.

## USING MATCH EVENTS

If Match Events are in use, each coach should roll a D16 at the start of each of their team turns, after moving their turn marker but before any player is activated. On the roll of a 1, something unexpected has happened and a Match Event is triggered. The coach of the active team immediately rolls a D8, and the coach of the inactive team rolls a D6. Both then consult the table below to see which of the Match Events has been triggered.

Once a Match Event has been triggered, it comes into effect immediately. After a Match Event has been triggered, there will not be another during the current half and there is no further need to roll a D16 at the start of each team turn for the remainder of the current half. If there is still a second half to play, both coaches should resume rolling a D16 at the start of each of their team turns during the second half. If the game goes into extra time, Match Events no longer apply.

### (1-2, 1) \*POP\*

*With a loud bang, the ball bursts! The rules are a little unclear on what's meant to happen in this scenario, but the ref is happy to let play continue for now and see what the players make of this unusual development!*

If the ball is not in the possession of a player, it is immediately removed from play and a marker placed in the square it was within. If the ball is in the possession of a player, that player is immediately placed Prone (it was a startlingly loud pop!), after which the ball will bounce until it comes to rest in an unoccupied square (a popped ball cannot be caught by any player). It is then removed from play and a marker placed in the square in which it came to rest.

After the popped ball has been removed from play, a replacement will not be made available until the referee has finished enjoying the antics. The coach of the active team rolls a D6 after each player has completed their activation, even if their activation ended with a Turnover. On a roll of 6, the referee tires of the display and a new ball is thrown onto the pitch. A new ball is placed on the pitch, in the square that contains the marker, and will immediately deviate from that square before landing.

Note that, until a 6 is rolled upon completing a player's activation, there will be no ball in play. This terrible predicament may continue indefinitely unless a 6 can be rolled (much to the amusement of the referee). However, at the end of the half, this Match Event ceases to apply and, at the start of the next half, a ball is made available to the players as usual.

### (1-2, 2) ENTHUSIASTIC APOTHECARY

*There's a new apothecary in town, and they're keen to show off their talents at the local Blood Bowl stadium in the hope of getting some lucrative work. They may not be any good but, if they're free, the coaches are willing to give them a chance!*

The next time an Injury roll is made against a player from either team, and if the result is 8-9, KO'd or 10+, Casualty!, the Enthusiastic Apothecary will rush forward to help that player. Roll a D6. On a roll of 4+, change the result of the Injury roll to 2-7, Stunned.

Note that, if the next time a roll is made on the Injury table against a player from either team the result is a 2-7, Stunned, this Match Event expires without effect.

### (1-2, 3) DODGY TRAPDOOR

*One of the trapdoors leading to the dungeon under the pitch has got a loose latch, and has swung open without warning! This could pose quite a hazard to the players, but no one seems concerned enough to halt play whilst it is fixed.*

Randomly select one of the two trapdoors on the pitch. Until the end of this drive, every time any player enters that Trapdoor square, for any reason, the trapdoor falls open and the player is immediately removed from play. Treat them exactly as if they had been pushed into the crowd. If the player was in possession of the ball, or should the ball come to rest in the Trapdoor square, it will be thrown back out by a helpful groundskeeper and deviates from the Trapdoor square.

### (1-2, 4) MOMENT OF GLORY

*One of the players has decided that this is their time to shine; they're playing for fame, glory and a place in the annals of sports history, and nothing is going to get in their way! It's exactly this sort of behaviour that makes the blooper reels so entertaining!*

Randomly select a player on the active team that is currently on the pitch. If that player is the first to be activated this team turn, they may re-roll a single dice rolled during their activation (this may be a dice rolled as a single dice, as part of a multiple dice roll, or as part of a dice pool). This re-roll may be used on its own, in conjunction with a Skill re-roll, or in conjunction with a team re-roll. Note, however, that a dice can never be re- rolled more than once, regardless of the source of the re-roll.

### (1-2, 5) FEUD!

*It turns out there's been a long- standing animosity between two opposing players. This has been well publicised in the gossip columns of late, with many promises of violence and settling scores. With the pair facing one another across the line of scrimmage, it looks like today is the day!*

Randomly select one player on each team that is currently on the pitch. If at any point during the remainder of this game, one of those players selected performs a Block action (on its own or as part of a Blitz) that targets the other selected player, the player performing the Block may apply a +2 modifier to their Strength characteristic, and gains the Mighty Blow (+1) skill. This modifier is applied before counting assists, before applying any other Strength modifiers and before using any other Skills or Traits. This Match Event remains in effect for the duration of this game.

### (1-2, 6) WEATHER MAGIC

*A Wizard, powerful in the mystical arts of meteorology, is present somewhere in the crowd of cheering fans. So far, they've resisted the urge to interfere with the game, but sooner or later they're bound to start meddling; it's just what Wizards do!*

Each coach rolls a D6 and adds their Fan Factor, re-rolling ties. The coach who rolls the highest can change the current weather conditions as they wish, choosing any result on the Weather table and applying those conditions immediately. Note, however, that the weather conditions must change, in other words, if the current weather conditions suit the coach that won the roll-off, they must still change the weather conditions!

### (3-4, 1) WISH DAEMON

*A locker room legend tells of a strange, floating creature which appears unexpectedly in the dugouts of struggling teams, offering a single wish to the beleaguered coach and the promise of changing fortunes. Apparently, this legend is true!*

The team with the lowest score is granted a single wish. If the score is tied, the team that started the game with the lowest Current Team Value is granted a single wish instead. If the score is tied and both teams started the game with the same Current Team Value, randomly select a team to be granted a wish.

The team that has been granted a wish places an appropriate marker on their dugout. Between now and the end of the game, they can discard the marker during any of their team turns in order to change the result rolled on any single dice (this may be a dice rolled as a single dice, as part of a multiple dice roll, or as part of a dice pool). This dice is not re-rolled; the coach may simply select the result they desire.

### (3-4, 2) DISTRACTED REF

*There's a sudden commotion in the stands! More precisely, there's suddenly a lot more commotion than is usual in the stands, and it's serious enough to draw the attention of the referee and other match officials! Quick, while no one is looking..*

If the active team has fewer than 11 players on the pitch when this Match Event is triggered, its coach may remove one player from the Reserves box of their dugout and set them up anywhere on the pitch. This player can be activated as normal during this team turn.

If the coach of the active team does not have any players in their Reserves box to place on the pitch, or if they choose not to, a single player on their team may commit a Foul action during this team turn without being Sent-off should they roll a natural double on either the Armour roll or the Injury roll.

### (3-4, 3) MAGICAL INTERFERENCE

*A robed fan, who has been watching quietly from the front row of the stands, suddenly stands up and starts waving his arms about in a complex pattern, chanting strange syllables. Fans scatter as they realise there's a Wizard in their midst and he's about to start flinging fireballs!*

The coach of the active team may choose a target square anywhere on the pitch. The target square is moved D3 squares in a direction determined by rolling a D8 and referring to the Random Direction template. After moving the target square, roll a D6 for each Standing player (from either team) that is either in the target square or a square adjacent to it:

* On a roll of 1-3, the player manages to avoid the Fireball.
* On a roll of 4+, the player has been hit by the Fireball.

Any Standing players hit by the Fireball are Knocked Down. When a player is Knocked Down by a Fireball, you may apply a +1 modifier to either the Armour roll or Injury roll. This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made. If a player on the active team is Knocked Down, this does not cause a Turnover unless the Knocked Down player was in possession of the ball.

### (3-4, 4) STREAKER

*Accompanied by much whooping and whistling from the crowd, a Dwarf fan wearing nothing but their (slightly tarnished) chainmail underwear leaps over the barrier and sprints as fast as their short legs can carry them across the pitch. They must have a death wish!*

The coach of the active team places a marker to represent the Streaker in any unoccupied square that is adjacent to one of the Sidelines (but not an End Zone). At the end of each team turn, the coach of that team places the Throw-in template over the Streaker, facing directly towards the Sideline opposite the Sideline from which the Streaker entered. The Streaker moves D3 squares in a direction determined by rolling a D6 and referring to the Throw-in template. The Streaker automatically passes any Agility tests they may be required to make in order to Dodge, regardless of any modifiers. Should the Streaker move off the pitch, they are removed from play.

During each team turn, the Streaker is considered to be an opposition player in all respects (please note that 'in all respects' means 'in all respects' with no exceptions; the Streaker is determined to cause maximum disruption!). The Streaker has the following profile:

|     | MA | ST | AG | PA | AV |
| -------- | -- | -- | --- | -- | -- |
| Streaker | D3 | 3 | N/A | - | 6+ |

Skills & Traits: [Dodge], [No Hands]

### (3-4, 5) DREADFUL STENCH

*Uh-oh.. have the facilities backed up again? Or is that the famed Nurgle's Rotters' fan club announcing their presence? Or, horror of horrors: is 'Dangerous' Daisy Palmer's Fried Lard Stand back in business? Whatever the cause, something smells truly awful.*

The coach of the active team places a marker in any square adjacent to either Sideline or either End Zone. This marker does not occupy the square in any way; it is there simply to mark the location. Until the end of this drive, any player performing a Pass action or a Throw Team-mate action, attempting Passing Interference, or attempting to catch or pick up the ball, suffers an additional -1 modifier to any PA or AG tests they must make.

### (3-4, 6) TUMBLING TIMBER

*The excitement in the stands is reaching fever pitch, and one group of revellers in particular are taking their revels a bit too far, ripping up the benches and throwing them down onto the pitch! They seem to be enjoying themselves, but some of the players don't look happy!*

The coach of the active team rolls a D6. On a roll of 1-3, the Wide Zone to the left of their End Zone is affected; on a roll of 4-6, the Wide Zone to the right of their End Zone is affected. Make an Armour roll for each player in the affected Wide Zone, as the players are bombarded with torn-up timber:

* If the Armour of the player hit is broken, they become Prone and an Injury roll is made against them. This Injury roll cannot be modified in any way.
* If the Armour of the player hit is not broken, this Match Event has no effect.

### (5-6, 1) TIZCAN WAVE

*It's the new craze that's sweeping the Blood Bowl circuit! Starting at one end of the stands, the fans stand up and raise their arms, before sitting back down, creating a magical sine wave around the stadium. Nothing brings the fans together like taking part as the wave circles the stadium.*

The coach of the active team places a marker in the leftmost square of their End Zone. This marker does not occupy the square in any way; it is there simply to mark the location. At the start of each team turn, including this one, the coach of the active team rolls a D16 and moves the marker that many spaces in a clockwise direction around the edge of the pitch.

If the marker is adjacent to one of the Sidelines, its effect extends through all of the squares in its row (i.e., between it and the opposite Sideline). If the marker is in an End Zone, its effect extends through all of the squares in its column (i.e., between it and the opposite End Zone).

Players from either team gain the Pro skill for as long as they occupy any square under the effect of the marker.

As soon as the marker reaches or passes the square it started in, or when the drive ends, it is removed from play.

### (5-6, 2) ABUSIVE FANS

*No one expects a Blood Bowl crowd to be polite and pleasant, but today the fans are going out of their way to insult the players. It'll put them off their game, sure, but it really isn't the wisest choice for fans who want to keep their legs intact..*

Until the end of this drive, any player, from either team, that is within three squares of either Sideline or either End Zone suffers an additional -1 modifier to any Agility or Passing Ability test they must make.

At the end of the drive, some players from each team make their way into the crowd to discuss some of the criticisms levelled at them by some of the fans. Both teams immediately reduce their Fan Factor by 1.

### (5-6, 3) AMNESTY

*It just so happens that today is the anniversary of the founding of the RARG, a cause for much celebration among members. This year, the referees and other officials have decided to celebrate the occasion by being lenient to both teams free of charge!*

Any player that has been Sent-off during the game so far is permitted to return to play and is returned to the Reserves box of their team's dugout. If no player has been Sent-off, the referee will not watch for fouls for the remainder of this drive if a Foul action is committed, the player committing it will not be Sent-off, even if a double is rolled (note that players can still be Sent-off for other reasons, such as using a Secret Weapon).

### (5-6, 4) ENCHANTED BALL

*From somewhere in the crowd there's the unmistakable sound of a spell being cast, and the ball suddenly takes on a life of its own! All it wants, it seems, is to be picked up and carried around. Hopefully, it won't take too long for the enchantment to be dispelled.*

Until the start of the active team's next team turn, any player may apply a +1 modifier to any attempt to pick up or catch the ball.

### (5-6, 5) BURNING BARREL

*A particularly mischievous fan has thrown a lit barrel of tar onto the pitch. Such behaviour shows complete disregard for the safety of players, officials and fans alike, and as such is frowned upon by some.*

The coach of the active team may choose a target square anywhere on the pitch. The target square is moved D3 squares in a direction determined by rolling a D8 and referring to the Random Direction template. If the target square would move off the pitch, or would end in an occupied square, it stops moving. After moving the target square, the coach of the active team places a marker in the target square.

The square containing the marker is occupied by the burning barrel. Players cannot enter this square or be pushed into it, and if the ball lands in or bounces into this square it will bounce again. In addition, the squares adjacent to the barrel are ablaze, and any attempt to pick up the ball within one of those squares suffers an additional -1 modifier. If a player ends their activation standing within one of those squares, roll a D6. If the result is higher than that player's Strength characteristic, they are immediately Knocked Down.

At the start of each team turn, the coach of the active team rolls a D6, adding 1 to the result if the current weather conditions are Pouring Rain or a Blizzard. On a roll of 6+, the fire goes out and the marker is removed. Otherwise, it is removed at the end of the current drive.

### (5-6, 6) COMMERCIAL ENDORSEMENT

*One of the players has signed a contract with a sponsor, agreeing to mention their product to the crowd during the match in exchange for some extra funds. Unfortunately, they forgot they were meant to do it until now.*

Randomly select one player on the active team that is currently on the pitch. That player cannot be activated at all during this team turn. In addition, that player loses their Tackle Zone for the duration of this team turn.

### (7-8, 1) SPRINKLER MALFUNCTION

*In the old days, it was standard NAF rules for all pitches to have mechanical water irrigation systems, thus ensuring the grass stayed nice and green. These days, these rules are enforced by the RARG, who couldn't care less, meaning that, unfortunately, they sometimes aren't well-maintained..*

Until the start of the active team's next team turn, apply an additional -1 modifier to all attempts to catch or pick up the ball, and to any passing interference attempts made.

### (7-8, 2) WHITEOUT

*The stadium is suddenly blanketed by a thick screen of mist. Perhaps this is a freak meteorological occurrence, or maybe magical trickery is involved - or maybe one of the contraptions in the local Engineers Guild has backfired again..*

For the remainder of the drive, any player wishing to move more than five squares during their activation must Rush in order to do so. For example, a player with MA 7 could move up to five squares normally, then up to four spaces by Rushing (this being the two remaining squares of their MA, plus the two Rush attempts that are normally allowed).

In addition, only Quick pass and Short pass actions can be attempted. Long pass and Long bomb Pass actions may not be attempted, and the Hail Mary Pass skill may not be used.

### (7-8, 3) APPEAL FOR SILENCE

*"Will the spectators please quieten down, and allow the players to concentrate on the game! This is the last time I shall ask nicely." Unfortunately, telling a Blood Bowl crowd what to do is never wise, and asking nicely isn't the only thing that the ref won't be doing for a while..*

Until the start of the active team's next team turn, there is no referee! Both teams can commit up to three Foul actions during their team turn, rather than the usual one, and even if a natural double is rolled when making either the Armour or Injury roll, the player committing the Foul will not be Sent-off (note, however, that should the drive end before the start of the active team's next team turn, players with the Secret Weapon trait can still be Sent-off).

### (7-8, 4) CAMRA CRASH

*High above the stadium, held aloft by alchemical ingenuity (and more than a little magic), a Cabalvision camera has been recording the match for broadcast. Suddenly, with a loud bang as something goes wrong within its workings, it is sent hurtling towards the pitch..*

The coach of the active team may choose a target square anywhere on the pitch. The target square is moved D3 squares in a direction determined by rolling a D8 and referring to the Random Direction template. If the target square would move off the pitch, it stops moving. After moving the target square, the coach of the active team places a marker in the target square.

If the target square, or any square adjacent to it, is occupied by a player, that player is immediately pushed back at least once, but no more than twice, in a direction chosen by the coach of the opposing team, so that they do not occupy either the target square or any square adjacent to the target square. If this player was Standing, they are Knocked Down. If this player was Prone or Stunned, an Armour roll is made against them.

For the remainder of the drive, the square containing the marker, and every square adjacent to it, are occupied with wreckage. Players may Jump over a square occupied by wreckage, but may not otherwise move into, over or through a square occupied by wreckage. If the ball bounces into a square that is occupied by wreckage, it will continue to bounce until it is caught by a Standing player or it comes to rest in an unoccupied square.

### (7-8, 5) PELTED WITH PROJECTILES

*The crowd, whether because they disapprove of what's happening on the pitch or because they're just bored, start flinging empty bottles, discarded food baskets, rotten fruit and all manner of other projectiles at the players. It's not enough to cause any harm, but it really does start piling up..*

For the remainder of the drive, any attempts to pick up the ball suffer an additional -1 modifier. In addition, if a player wishes to Rush more than once during their activation, the second (and any subsequent attempts) will suffer a -1 modifier.

### (7-8, 6) TOTAL DARKNESS

*Hey, who turned out the lights? Thanks to strange and mysterious magical interference (or maybe it's due to something less sinister, after all, some matches are played at night or underground, and sometimes it just goes dark!), the pitch is drowned in darkness.*

Until the start of the active team's next team turn, the MA of each and every player on the pitch is halved (rounding fractions up). In addition, all players suffer an additional -2 modifier when testing for the accuracy of a Pass action, or when attempting to catch the ball.
