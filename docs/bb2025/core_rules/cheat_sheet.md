|-----|------------------|
| **2** | **SWELTERING HEAT:** At the end of each Drive, one coach rolls a D3. Each coach randomly selects that many of their players that were on the pitch when the Drive ended. The selected players are placed in the Reserves Box and cannot be set up on the pitch for the next Drive. |

| **4–10** | **PERFECT CONDITIONS:** There is no additional effect. |
| **11** | **POURING RAIN:** Whenever a player attempts to pick up or Catch the ball, or Intercept a Pass Action, they suffer a –1 modifier to the roll. |
| **12** | **BLIZZARD:** Whenever a player attempts to Rush, apply a –1 modifier to the roll. Additionally, when a player makes a Pass Action, they may only attempt to make a Quick Pass or a Short Pass. |

### THE TURNOVER

A Turnover is caused if:

* A player on the active team Falls Over during their own activation.
* A player on the active team is Knocked Down during their own team's turn.
* A player on the active team that is carrying the ball is Placed Prone or forced to move off the pitch for any reason.

* A player on the active team attempts a Pass Action and Fumbles the ball.
* A player on the active team attempts to catch the ball following a Pass Action or a Hand-off Action and fails, resulting in it coming to rest on the ground. If the ball Bounces from the player who failed to Catch it directly into a square containing a player from the active team who successfully Catches the ball, no Turnover is caused.
* A player on the active team attempts a Pass Action and no player on the active team successfully Catches the ball, resulting in the ball hitting the ground and Bouncing or coming to rest on the ground.
* A player on the inactive team ends up in possession of the ball following an attempted Pass Action or by successfully Intercepting the ball.
* A player on the active team that is in possession of the ball is thrown by a team-mate and fails to land safely, lands in the crowd, or is eaten.

### KICK-OFF EVENT TABLE

| 2D6 | KICK-OFF EVENT |
|-----|----------------|
| **2** | **GET THE REF:** Each team immediately receives one free Bribe Inducement. This Bribe must be used by the end of the game or it is lost. |
| **3** | **TIME-OUT:** If the kicking team's Turn Marker is on turn 6, 7 or 8 for the half, move both teams' Turn Marker back one space. Otherwise, move both teams' Turn Marker forwards one space. |
| **4** | **SOLID DEFENCE:** The Coach of the kicking team selects up to D3+3 Open players on their team. The selected players are then removed from the pitch and can be set up again following all the usual restrictions for setting up the team. |
| **5** | **HIGH KICK:** One Open player on the receiving team may immediately be placed in the square the ball is going to land in. |
| **6** | **CHEERING FANS:** Both Coaches roll a D6 and add the number of Cheerleaders on their Team Roster. The first Block Action performed during the Coach with the highest roll's next Turn receives an additional Offensive Assist. If both Coaches roll the same, both will receive this benefit during their next Turn. |
| **7** | **BRILLIANT COACHING:** Both Coaches roll a D6 and add the number of Assistant Coaches on their Team Roster. The Coach with the highest total, or both Coaches in the result of a tie, immediately gains a free Team Re-roll for the Drive ahead. If this free Team Re-roll has not been used by the end of the Drive, it is lost. |
| **8** | **CHANGING WEATHER:** Immediately make a new roll on the Weather Table. If the new result is Perfect Conditions, the ball will Scatter (3) in the air before it lands. |
| **9** | **QUICK SNAP!:** The Coach of the receiving team selects up to D3+3 Open players on their team. The selected players may immediately move one square in any direction, even if this takes them into the opposition half. |
| **10** | **CHARGE!:** The Coach of the kicking team selects up to D3+3 Open players on their team. The selected players may then be activated one at a time, exactly as if it was their team's Turn, and perform a free Move Action. One of the selected players may instead perform a free Blitz Action, one may perform a free Throw Team-mate Action, and one may perform a free Kick Team-mate Action. If a selected player Falls Over or is Knocked Down during their activation, no further selected players can be activated and the Charge ends. |
| **11** | **DODGY SNACK:** Both Coaches roll a D6. The Coach that rolled the lowest, or both Coaches in the result of a tie, randomly selects one of their players on the pitch and rolls a D6. On a 2+, the player's pre-drive snack has not gone down well and for the duration of the Drive the player reduces their MA and AV by 1. On a 1, the player's pre-drive snack has violently disagreed with them; place the player in the Reserves box as they spend the rest of the Drive locked in the lavatory! |
| **12** | **PITCH INVASION:** Both Coaches roll a D6 and add their Fan Factor. The Coach that rolled lowest, or both Coaches in the result of a tie, randomly selects D3 of their players on the pitch. The selected players are immediately Placed Prone and become Stunned. |

### PLAYER ACTIVATIONS
During your Turn, you may activate each of your Standing and/or Prone players to perform one action available to them. Players that began the turn Stunned cannot be activated. Common Actions include:

| ACTION | NOTES | RULEBOOK REFERENCE |
|--------|--------|---------------------|
| **MOVE** | Up to MA, can Rush | Page 54 |
| **BLOCK** | Block adjacent player | Page 60 |
| **BLITZ** | Move then Block | Page 64 |
| **PASS** | Move, then Pass the ball | Page 70 |
| **HAND-OFF** | Pass to adjacent player, roll to Catch only | Page 74 |
| **FOUL** | Move, then Foul adjacent Prone opposing player | Page 69 |
| **THROW TEAM-MATE** | “Pass” a player with the Right Stuff Trait | Page 76 |
| **SPECIAL ACTIONS** | Skill or Trait Action | Page 123 |
| **SECURE THE BALL** | Move, then pick up the ball safely | Page 59 |

### PASS ACTION
Once per team turn, a player with the ball can perform the Pass Action. Follow the sequence:

1. **Declare Target Square.**
2. **Measure Range** — Use the Range Ruler or Passing Range chart to measure range to the target square and determine the type of pass required.
3. **Test for Accuracy** — Make a Passing Ability Test for the player performing the Pass Action. Apply modifiers.
4. **Interceptions** — A player on the opposing team can attempt to intercept the ball.
5. **Resolve Pass Action** — Determine if the ball is caught by the target player or where it comes to rest.

### BLOCK ACTION
Resolve a Block Action by rolling Block Dice and choosing one result. The number of Block Dice rolled is determined by comparing the modified Strength of the blocker and their target.

* If both players have equal modified Strength, roll one Block Die.
* If one player has higher modified Strength, two Block Dice are rolled.\*
* If one player has over double the other's modified Strength, three Block Dice are rolled.\*

\**The Coach of the player with the higher Strength Characteristic chooses the result used.*

#### ASSISTING A BLOCK ACTION
A common way of modifying a player's Strength during Block Actions is through Assists.

* Blocking players gain a +1 Strength modifier for each player of the same team who is Marking the target of the Block Action and is not Marked by another opposing player.
* The target of a Block gains a +1 Strength modifier for each player of the same team who is Marking the player performing the Block Action and is not Marked by another opposing player.


### BLOCK DICE

**PLAYER DOWN**

The player performing the Block Action is immediately Knocked Down by the target player as if the target player had performed a Block Action.

**BOTH DOWN**

The player that performed the Block Action and the target player are Knocked Down by each other if in the squares they are in as if they had both performed a Block Action.

**PUSH BACK**

The target player is Pushed Back by the player performing the Block Action. The player that performed the Block Action may choose to Follow-up by moving into the square vacated by the Pushed player.

**STUMBLE**

If the target player has the [Dodge] skill, this becomes Push Back. Otherwise, this becomes POW.

**POW**

Apply the Push Back result to the target player. The target player is then Knocked Down in the square they are now in by the player performing the Block Action.

### RISKING INJURY
When a player is Knocked Down or Falls Over, they become Prone and risk injury. The opposing team's Coach makes an Armour roll against that player — see page 37 for Armour Rolls.

#### INJURY ROLLS
If the Armour Roll results in a player's armour being broken, the opposing team's Coach rolls 2D6 and consults the table below:

#### INJURY TABLE

| 2D6 | RESULT |
|-----|--------|
| **2–7** | **STUNNED:** The player is immediately Stunned. |
| **8–9** | **KNOCKED-OUT:** The player is immediately Knocked-out. Remove them from the pitch and place them in the Knocked-out box of their dugout. |
| **10–12** | **CASUALTY:** The player suffers a Casualty. Remove them from the pitch and place them in the Casualty box of their dugout. The Coach of the opposing team then makes a Casualty Roll against them (page 67). |

#### CASUALTY TABLE
| D16 | RESULT |
|-----|--------|
| **1–8** | **BADLY HURT:** The player suffers no long-term effects. |
| **9–10** | **SERIOUSLY HURT:** The player must miss their next game. |
| **11–12** | **SERIOUS INJURY:** The player suffers a Niggling Injury and must miss their next game. |
| **13–14** | **LASTING INJURY:** The player suffers a characteristic reduction and must miss their next game. |
| **15–16** | **DEAD:** The player is dead. |

#### LASTING INJURY TABLE
| D6 | LASTING INJURY | CHARACTERISTIC REDUCTION |
|----|----------------|--------------------------|
| **1–2** | HEAD INJURY | –1 AV |
| **3** | SMASHED KNEE | –1 MV |
| **4** | BROKEN ARM | –1 PA |
| **5** | DISLOCATED HIP | –1 AG |
| **6** | BROKEN SHOULDER | –1 ST |

### INJURY BY THE CROWD
Make an Injury Roll for a player Pushed into the Crowd (page 68). If the player would be Stunned, place them in their team's Reserve Box. Otherwise, follow the result on the relevant Injury Table.

### STALLING
If a player in possession of the ball when activated can score a Touchdown without having to roll dice but finishes their activation without having scored a Touchdown, then they are Stalling. Roll a D6 if a player is Stalling — if the result is equal to or greater than the team's current Turn number, the player is Knocked Down and a Turnover is caused.

### FOULING
Make an Armour Roll for the target of the Foul Action. Apply a +1 modifier to the result for each Offensive Assist and –1 modifier to the result for each Defensive Assist.
