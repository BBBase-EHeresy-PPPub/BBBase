Not everyone has the time to commit to a full blown league, and may also not find the appeal in the likes of tournaments and gaming weekends. For those Coaches, there is Exhibition Play, which allows them the freedom to explore Blood Bowl in a way that best suits them.

The flexible nature of Exhibition Play is perfect for Coaches who want to try something a little different from the norm. Perhaps they want to increase the number of Star Players allowed on each team, or perhaps play a game using only one type of player from a team's roster! What about using alternative Weather and Kick-off Event Tables, or even creating your own to fit a particular narrative. You could even explore the idea of creating your own mixed teams by combining multiple Team Rosters to form your own, unique teams - Exhibition Play allows you to let your imagination loose and create your own game play experience.

## DRAFTING AN EXHIBITION PLAY TEAM!

Drafting an Exhibition Play team works in the same way as drafting a team for Matched Play as described on page 110, ensuring that both Coaches have an equally balanced Team Draft List to the same amount of gold pieces. Of course, in Exhibition Play you are free to tweak certain elements of this however you wish in order to fit your desired narrative.

We would recommend that both teams are still built to the same cost, and that both Coaches are fully aware of and agree to whatever changes are being made to the process when drafting their teams.

### HISTORICAL GAMES
Many Blood Bowl publications provide historical rosters depicting some of the most famous teams in Nuffle's sacred game at the height of their power. Being such dominant teams they will often have large Current Team Values to represent the huge amount of Skills their players have gained over their storied careers. Exhibition Play is the perfect place to recreate classic matches from the history of the great game, or to pit these teams against each other to see who would come out on top in a real Blood Bowl match!

### GETTING CREATIVE
Exhibition Play is the perfect place for Coaches to get creative, providing the opportunity to customise elements of the game to give your games that personal twist that is unique to you. In Exhibition Play, Coaches are free to tweak whatever elements of the game they wish in order to fit the narrative they are trying to tell, so long as both Coaches agree of course!

This could simply be done by altering the way Team Draft Lists are presented, perhaps by gifting both teams some Inducements for free or lifting any restrictions surrounding Star Players. You could also create your own rules for specific pitches; perhaps one team plays at home in their particular stadium with its own rules, and then the next time you play the other team plays at their stadium with a different set of rules.

You could even go as far as to create your own Inducements, or even use players from previous Team Draft Lists as custom Star Players, allowing you to bring your favourite plays from your leagues into a single one-off game.

The opportunities for creativity in Exhibition Play are limitless for Coaches of all skill levels and gaming styles. If you have ever wanted to try a specific type of Blood Bowl match, then this is the style of play for you!
