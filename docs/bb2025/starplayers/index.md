# STAR PLAYERS!

Star Players are the legends of the game; players who have created a lasting legacy for themselves on the pitch through their exceptional play, immense talent, outlandish personalities, or even their penchant for extreme violence - and in many cases it is more than one!

Naturally, such players are heralded by both fans and pundits alike, and whenever they step onto the pitch the crowd goes wild with anticipation. These players use their notoriety and fame to enjoy their life as a free agent, able to play for multiple teams so long as many fork out a tempting hiring fee or lucrative short-term contract. Such investment by a team is seldom wasted though; not only will the cash benefit from the sales of team shirts with the hired star player's name on them, and charging fans for photos with the player at a pre-game meet and greet.

Star players come in all manner of shapes and sizes, and each have their own area of expertise. In other words there is a star player to fit your needs in almost every situation - so long as you can pay the gold, of course!

# STAR PLAYERS LIST!

Over the following pages, we will present some of the Star Players currently available in the game of Blood Bowl. Each is a player that has carved their name in the annals of Blood Bowl, be it through jaw-dropping feats of athleticism or infamous moments of unscrupulous behaviour! More Star Players can be found in the Star Players PDF on warhammer-community.com, and some may appear in future Blood Bowl publications.

Each Star Player has its own profile, complete with all of the Characteristics, Skills and Traits that they possess. The profile will also have a 'Plays For' section, which will list one or more of the Leagues & Traits Star Players can play for.

Star Players can only play for teams that have the same League as them. In some situations, a Star Player may not have a League listed, and may have a special rule listed instead. In these situations, the Star Player can only play for a team that also has that special rule.

**Example one:** Griff Oberwald can play for teams from the Old World Classic, and so a team must have chosen the Old World Classic League when their Team Roster was drafted in order to hire Griff Oberwald.

**Example two:** A Star Player with the Favoured of Khorne special rule can only play for teams that have the Favoured of Khorne special rule, and not those that have chosen any other type of Favoured of... such as Nurgle or Slaanesh.

Each Star Player profile will also have a cost in gold pieces that a team must pay to hire them, as well as their own unique special rule that they can use during the game.

In League Play, Star Players can be hired as Inducements as described on page 142. In Matched Play or Exhibition Play, Star Players can be hired with gold pieces from a Team Draft Budget, and using Skill Points, as described on page 112.
