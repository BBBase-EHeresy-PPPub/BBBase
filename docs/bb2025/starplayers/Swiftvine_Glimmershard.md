Once per half, so long as she is Standing at the start of her activation, Swiftvine can place herself adjacent to a Standing opposition player within 3 squares of her and immediately make a Stab Special Action against them. She may then place herself in an unoccupied square within 3 squares of her new position. Her activation then immediately ends. This counts as the team's Blitz Action for the turn.
