Once per game, when Grashnak performs a Block Action as part of a Blitz Action, he may roll one additional Block Dice against the opposition player regardless of their ST, to a maximum of three Block Dice. If Grashnak performs a second Block Action due to the Frenzy Skill, the second Block Action will also benefit from this rule.
