Once per half, at the start of his activation, Zzharg may select a Standing opposition player within 3 squares and roll a D6. On a 3+, the selected player is hit. On a 2, the opposing coach selects a player (from either team, but not Zzharg) within 3 squares of the originally selected player to be hit instead. On a 1, Zzharg is hit instead. Make an Armour Roll for whichever player is hit. Zzharg's activation then immediately ends.
