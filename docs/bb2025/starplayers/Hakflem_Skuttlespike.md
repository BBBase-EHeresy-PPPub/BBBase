Once per game, if Hakflem is adjacent to a team-mate who is in possession of the ball when he is activated, then Hakflem can choose to gain possession of the ball. If he does, then the team-mate will immediately be Knocked Down. This will not cause a Turnover even if the team-mate suffers a Casualty.
