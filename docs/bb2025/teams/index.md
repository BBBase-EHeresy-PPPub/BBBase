Over the following pages, we present you with the Team Rosters for all the teams currently available to play in Blood Bowl. Each Team Roster will have a section of information detailing the background and context of the team, as well as the names of some of the most famous teams of that type.

The Team Roster will also have all the player types that can be hired by the team, complete with their player profile. It will also have the Leagues that the team can choose from, as well as any special rules that the team has. The Team Roster will also state how many gold pieces the team’s Team Re-rolls will cost, and whether or not the team can take an Apothecary.

Currently there are 29 different Team Rosters, each representing a different race and faction within the world of Blood Bowl. Whilst these are the only playable teams right now, new teams may become available in future Blood Bowl publications.

# SELECTING LEAGUES!

As mentioned previously, when creating a Team Draft List you will need to select which League your team is from. For many teams, they only have one option and so the choice is simple – Human teams only play in the Old World Classic League for example.

Other teams may have multiple Leagues on their Team Roster. When this is the case, you will need to choose which of them your team is from and note it down on your Team Draft List. This will impact which Star Players and Inducements your team can purchase. For example, an Ogre team has the choice of either Badlands Brawl or Worlds Edge Superleague and so a Coach taking an Ogre team will need to decide which of the two Leagues their Ogre team is from.

In some instances, choosing a particular League may also provide additional special rules to the team. For example, a Norse team has the choice of either Old World Classic or Chaos Clash. If they choose Chaos Clash, then they also gain the Favoured of Khorne special rule.
