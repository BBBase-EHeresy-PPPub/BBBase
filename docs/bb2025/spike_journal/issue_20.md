## KHEMRI CLASSIC CUP

The people of Nehekhara have been running Blood Bowl leagues since before most nations even existed! Necrotects still frequently object to the cost of converting old stadia to match new regulations, stating "We hate change!", "It was better in my day!" and "This is evidence the game is dead!". Nevertheless, the elaborate ambiance of Nehekharan architecture is much-loved by Cabalvision networks and so the Tomb Kings host a multitude of exciting leagues!

Here at Spike! Journal, we pride ourselves on showcasing the Blood Bowl that readers love, so we sent reporters out into the sandy deserts of Nehekhara to soak in the glory of their leagues and get a lowdown on what fans and players alike can expect.

From the shores of Zandri to the craters of Rasetra, the sandstone stadia of Nehekhara ring with the bone-crunching tackles of Blood Bowl. Yet the punching arms of the foes aren't the only threat; from the goody jars handed out by Liche Priests to the oppressive sun and swarms of flesh-eating scarabs, the balance of a match can change at a moment's notice. Pitchside drama is also in good supply - nothing is more entertaining than watching Tomb Guardians thundering down from the crowd to show everyone how things are done!

This is a variation on a standard Blood Bowl league season, as described in the Blood Bowl rulebook. How the league itself is organised, the number of teams, how many divisions there are, how many rounds are played, and so forth, should all be decided upon by the League Commissioner based on how many coaches wish to take part, and what is best for everyone participating. The Khemri Classic Cup differs from a normal season, however, in a couple of key aspects.

**Open to All**

The Khemri Classic Cup is open to all comers. Coaches participating may use any team they wish and will have the usual budget of 1,000,000 gold pieces to spend to recruit their team for the season ahead.

### Many glorious prizes!

Teams that manage to win a league in Nehekhara are well-rewarded with arcane blessings, gold-filled jars and a stunning trophy! The top placed teams of the Khemri Classic Cup are rewarded as follows:

**Glittering Prizes:** Teams that finish 1st, 2nd and 3rd receive gold pieces as described in the Blood Bowl rulebook.

**The Trophy:** In addition to their cash prize, the winner will receive the prestigious Khemri Classic Cup. Fashioned by the hands of Necrotects and blessed by Liche Priests, it is said that those who give offerings to the cup gain a glimpse of immortality the people of Nehekhara once dreamed of. The team that holds the Trophy gains the following ability:

At the start of each game, randomly select a player on your team that is eligible to play in the game. The selected player gains the [Regeneration] Trait until the end of the game. If they already have the Trait, that player's Regeneration Rolls succeed on a 2+ instead of a 4+.

### Inducements

All Inducements should be allowed in the Khemri Classic Cup. Additionally, if the League Commissioner wishes, the following Inducements may be added:

#### 0-1 Canopic Jar 
**(50,000 gold pieces) Available to any team**

Liche priests use canopic jars to store everything, from bottled plagues to their personal scarab collection. Unfortunately, all the labels have rubbed off over the millennia!

Once per game, at the start of their team turn, a team that has purchased a Canopic Jar may open it. Roll a D6 and consult the chart on the next page.

| D6 | Result |
|----|--------|
| 1 | **Unholy Curse:** It seems that was a bad jar… Randomly select two of your players on the pitch. For the duration of the Drive, those players reduce their MA and AV by 1. |
| 2 | **Blessing of Ptra:** The holy light of Ptra shines from this jar. Randomly select two of your players on the pitch. For the duration of the Drive, those players gain the [Disturbing Presence] Skill. |
| 3 | **Blessing of Basth:** The jar contains offerings to Basth, goddess of grace, and her blessing is swift in coming. Choose one of your players on the pitch. Once during the Drive, when that player fails a Dodge Roll, you may choose to pass it instead. |
| 4 | **Blessing of Qu'aph:** A veil of shadows seeps from the jar, a blessing from the god of subtlety. Randomly select one of your players on the pitch. For the duration of the Drive, that player gains the [Trickster] Trait. |
| 5 | **Blessing of Gehep:** Geheb's strength flows out and infuses the players. Randomly select one of your players on the pitch. For the duration of the Drive, those players increase their AV by 1 and gain the [Mighty Blow] Skill. |
| 6 | **Blessings of Khsar:** A mote of power from the Desert Wind spills from the jar to empower the team for a moment of glory. Until the end of the team turn, all players on your team increase their MA by 1. However, at the end of the Drive, randomly select a player that was on the pitch when the Drive ended. The selected player is placed in the Reserves Box and cannot be set up on the pitch for the next Drive. |

### Nehekharan Desert Weather Table

| 2D6  | Result |
|-----------|-------------|
| 2 | **Sweltering Heat:** The intense heat causes some players to faint! At the end of each Drive whilst this weather condition is in effect, one Coach rolls a D3 and each Coach randomly selects that many of their players that were on the pitch when the Drive ended. The selected players are placed in the Reserves Box and cannot be set up on the pitch for the next Drive. |
| 3 | **Very Sunny:** The glorious sunshine makes for a beautiful day, but plays havoc with the passing game! Whenever a player makes a Passing Ability Test, apply a -1 modifier to the roll. |
| 4-10 | **Perfect Conditions:** Hot, but not scorching. It's perfect weather for Blood Bowl! There is no additional effect. |
| 11 | **Sandstorm:** Punishing winds have stirred up a sandstorm that has cut visibility and driven the referee inside. No Pass or Throw Team-mate Actions can be performed, and no player may attempt to Rush. In addition, players cannot be Sent-off for committing a Foul, even if they roll a natural double on either the Armour Roll or the Injury Roll. |
| 12 | **Scarab Swarm:** The acrobatic scarab swarms brought by the local Liche Priests have got loose and they're hungry for flesh. Whenever a player's armour is broken, apply a +1 modifier to the Injury Roll. |


### Nehekharan Kick-off Event Table

| 2D6  | Result |
|-----------|-------------|
| 2 | **Snake!:** The players disturb a sleeping snake, who decides to sharply highlight their annoyance! Both Coaches roll a D6. The Coach that rolled the lowest, or both Coaches in the result of a tie, randomly selects one of their players on the pitch. For the duration of the Drive, selected players reduce their ST by 1. |
| 3 | **Shifting Sands:** Building stadium on sand is also a bad idea... Both Coaches roll a D6. The Coach with the highest total, or both Coaches in the result of a tie, randomly selects three of their players on the pitch then rolls a D8. Each player immediately moves two squares in the direction determined by the Random Direction Template. If they would move into the square of another player, the player is Pushed Back away from the moving player's square, in a direction chosen by you. This move ignores Tackle Zones, can result in a player being Pushed into the Crowd, and can take a player into the opposition's half. |
| 4 | **Fistful of Sand:** Sand is a useful tool for a devious player. Starting with the Kicking team, each Coach selects an opposition player that is Marked by one of their players. That selected player becomes Distracted. |
| 5 | **High Kick:** Apply the High Kick result as normal. |
| 6 | **Cheering Fans:** Apply the Cheering Fans result as normal. |
| 7 | **Brilliant Coaching:** Apply the Brilliant Coaching result as normal. |
| 8 | **Changing Weather:** Make a new roll on the Nehekharan Desert Weather table and apply that result. If the result is 'Perfect Conditions' as a result of the roll, the ball will Scatter (3) before landing. |
| 9 | **Quick Snap:** Apply the Quick Snap result as normal. |
| 10 | **Dead Quiet:** A stadium full of empty eye sockets and whispery cheers can be rather disconcerting. For the duration of both Coaches' next Team Turn, players that begin their activation within a Wide Zone have the [Bone Head] Trait until the end of their activation. |
| 11 | **Cursed Domain:** Some ancient magical ward placed upon the stadium has been activated, inflicting a wasting curse on the players - let's hope it's temporary! For the duration of the Drive, all players gain the [Decay] Trait. |
| 12 | **"Do You Know Who I Am?!":** Some Tomb Guardians can't reconcile the fact that the spotlight has moved on and they're no longer a celebrity. Both Coaches immediately gain a Tomb Guardian for the duration of the Drive. This can mean that teams have more than 11 players on the pitch for this Drive. These Tomb Guardians can be placed anywhere in their team's half, but not in either of the Wide Zones. At the end of the Drive, remove the Tomb Guardians from play as they stomp off at the lack of adoration directed towards them. |

## Pyramid Catacombs Blood Bowl Pitch

The Tomb Kings loved nothing more than constructing grand tombs for their royalty that also functioned as Blood Bowl stadia; what better way to honour the dead than playing sports on their grave! While these tombs provide grand backdrops for each game, they come with a few side effects, like forgetting about traps and the dangers of inhabitants who are just want to nap for a few centuries!

The Tomb Kings Pyramid Pitch has two sides - one depicting the well-lit gridiron in the centre of a pyramid and the other the lower levels, swirling with arcane energy and the screams of "Why have you awoken me?", from the dead who were sleeping there!

**Hidden Traps:** Pyramids were built with all manner of traps and pitfalls designed to protect the treasure of the interred. Now, they make great surprises for Blood Bowl players! If a player Falls Over as a result of attempting to Dodge, Leap, move away from a Tackle Zone or as part of a Rush, the opposing Coach rolls a D6 before an Armour Roll is made. On a 1, the player has fallen into a pit trap - they are treated as being Pushed into the Crowd.

Additionally, at the end of the first half, flip the board over onto the Wailing Souls side as all the screaming fans and clamour of Blood Bowl wakes up the dozens of souls trying to get some rest!

**Wailing Souls:** The temple-stadia's denizens have awoken, and all that screaming and wailing is enough to terrify the bravest of players. If a player moves from a square in the Centre Field to a square in the Wide Zones, the controlling Coach rolls a D6. On a 1, that player's activation immediately ends.

## Tomb Kings Balls

**Canopic Jar Ball**

When a player fails to pick up a Canopic Jar ball, the ball Scatters (3) from the player's square. If the final square it lands in is occupied by a player, and that player fails to Catch the ball, that player is Placed Prone and the ball Bounces as normal.

**Sphinx Ball**

A player may not declare a Secure the Ball Action to attempt to pick up a Sphinx Ball. If a player in possession of the Ball is Knocked Down, apply a +1 modifier to the subsequent Armour Roll as the cat expresses their displeasure at being dropped.

## Special rules & achievements

To make your game even more exciting, and even more of a challenge, why not try to complete these achievements as you play? There are three achievements per team that you can try to accomplish; can you get all three and still lead your team into the annals of Blood Bowl history? Additionally, these achievements make for a great tiebreaker. If the game ends in a draw, then the team that has completed the most achievements is the winner.

### Special rules

**And they're off!:** For this game, do not roll to determine which player kicks and which receives. Instead, the Itza Nokouts are automatically the kicking team in the first half. Additionally, do not roll on the Weather table at the start of the game; the weather is automatically 'Perfect Conditions' at the start of the game.

**Humidity: skincare's worst enemy!:** During this game, Tomb Guardians cannot use their Regeneration Trait.

**For the glory of Setti the Impervious:** If the Nehekhara Nightmares score a Touchdown in the first half of the game, do not roll on the Kick-off Event Table during the first Drive of the second half. Instead, the Charge! result is automatically applied.

**Apex predator:** If the Tomb Guardian Ra'Cophagus the Unmoving suffers a Casualty or is Knocked-out then the Kroxigor Oautli'Botki loses Bone Head for the rest of the game. If the Casualty or Knock-out was caused by a player other than Oautli'Botki, the Kroxigor loses Bone Head and gains Animal Savagery instead.

### Achievements

#### Nehekhara Nightmares

**Back for round two?:** Have the Kroxigor Oautli'Botki suffer a Casualty or be Knocked-out as a result of a Block Action performed by the Tomb Guardian Ra'Cophagus the Unmoving.

**Hide from this:** Have both Chameleon Skinks Prone and Stunned, Knocked-out and/or in the Casualty Box at the same time. The Chameleon Skinks don't have to have the same condition, but each must have one of them.

**Dead quick:** Perform a Blitz Action with Akhenateb the Harefooted and successful Dodge during that Action.

#### Itza Nokouts

**The beast remembers:** Have the Tomb Guardian Ra'Cophagus the Unmoving suffer a Casualty or be Knocked-out as a result of a Block Action performed by the Kroxigor Oautli'Botki.

**Slippery little fellows:** Successfully perform a Pass Action that results in either Chiqqui or Itzbitzy, both Skink Lineman, catching the ball. This cannot be achieved with a Quick Pass.

**The bigger they are:** Have a Tomb Guardian suffer a Casualty or be Knocked-out as a result of a Foul Action performed by a Skink Lineman or Chameleon Skink.
