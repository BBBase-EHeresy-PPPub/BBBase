## THE JOLLY JOUSTER CUP

This is a variation on a standard Blood Bowl league season, as described in the Blood Bowl rulebook. How the league itself is organised, the number of teams, how many divisions there are, how many rounds are played, and so forth, should all be decided upon by the League Commissioner based upon how many coaches wish to take part, and what is best for everyone participating. The Jolly Jouster Cup differs from a normal season, however, in a couple of key aspects.

**Open to Honourable Folk**

The Jolly Jouster Cup is based in Bretonnia where honour and chivalry is placed above all. As a result, teams with the Bribery and Corruption special rule must purchase their first Bribe inducement for the normal 100,000 gold pieces - no Knightly referee would have their honour besmirched by accepting a cheaper bribe first! Additional bribes cost 50,000 as normal; in for a copper, in for a gold!

Coaches participating may use any team they wish and will have the usual budget of 1,000,000 gold pieces to spend to recruit their team for the season ahead.

### Inducements

All Inducements should be allowed in the Jolly Jouster Cup. Additionally, if the League Commissioner wishes, the following Inducements may be added:

#### 0-1 Bretonnian Pastries

**(15,000 gold pieces) Available to any team**

Once per game, if a team has Bretonnian Pastries and a player on the team has been Knocked-out, the Coach may declare they are using Bretonnian Pastries. The Coach rolls a D6, and on a 2+ the player is placed in the Reserves Box of their Dugout instead. On a natural 1, the player awakens, eats the pastry and promptly enters a food coma - they are still Knocked-out and the Pastries are lost.

#### 0-1 Bretonnian Damsel

**(150,000 gold pieces) Available to any team**

Once per game, a Bretonnian Damsel can cast either Zap! (see page 149 of the Blood Bowl rulebook) or High Winds:

**High Winds**

At the end of any Turn, before the next Turn begins, you may select any square on the pitch. Roll a D6 for any player that is in or adjacent to the selected square. For adjacent players, on a roll of a 2+, the player is Pushed Back away from the chosen square into a square of your choice. For a player in the selected square, on a roll of a 4+, they are immediately Knocked Down. On any other result, nothing happens.

### Many Glorious Prizes!

Teams that manage to win a league in Bretonnia are well rewarded with praise, ballads, pouches of gold and a stunning trophy! The top placed teams of the Jolly Jouster Cup are rewarded as follows:

**Glittering Prizes:** As usual, the teams that finish 1st, 2nd and 3rd receive gold pieces as described in the Blood Bowl rulebook.

**The Jouster's Chalice Trophy:** In addition to their cash prize, the winner will receive the blessed Jouster's Chalice Trophy. Modelled after an artist's rendition of the Grail, it is said to bless the boldest players with bursts of strength! The team that holds the Jouster's Chalice Trophy gains the following ability:

At the start of each game, nominate six players on your team and assign them a number between 1 and 6. Roll a D6; the player with the assigned number that matches the roll gains the [Dauntless] Skill for the duration of the game.

### The Dukedoms of Bretonnia

The following table is used to represent the effects playing in the various Dukedoms will have on the game, as both peasants and nobles alike show their local pride. For the duration of the Jolly Jouster Cup, one Coach rolls a D8 at the beginning of each game and consults the table below.

| D8 | Result |
|----|--------|
| 1 | **Brionne:** The lyrical prowess of Brionne's minstrels is well known and even the crowd's improvised chants don't sound too ear-splittingly awful! For the duration of the game, each team gains a Team Mascot inducement. |
| 2 | **Couronne:** The people of Couronne love little more than showing off their horses in grand, ground shaking parades. For the duration of the game, all players must apply a -1 modifier to the roll each time they attempt to Rush. |
| 3 | **Bastonne:** Bastonne is often said to be the spiritual heart of Bretonnia and is famed for the many Damsels who take residence there. For the duration of the game, each team gains a Bretonnian Damsel inducement. |
| 4 | **Parravon:** Many Parravon stadia have Pegasus roosts built in, which can lead to some unfortunate circumstances. At the start of each Drive, both Coaches randomly select one of their players on the pitch. Until the end of that Drive, those players have the [Foul Appearance] and [Disturbing Presence] Skills. |
| 5 | **Mousillon:** Mousillon may be a dreary place but their medical skills are miraculous - even death doesn't always take! For the duration of the game, all players gain the [Regeneration] Skill if they do not already have it. |
| 6 | **Bordeleaux:** The nobles of Bordeleaux are famous for their wine. For the duration of the game each team receives two Bordeleaux Caskets - for rules purposes, these function in the same way as Blitzer's Best Kegs. Neither team may purchase additional Blitzer's Best Kegs. |
| 7 | **Quenelles:** Stupefying magic is abound due to a visiting delegation from Athel Loren! Each Coach selects one player on their team; for the duration of the game the selected player gains the [Trickster] skill. At the end of a Drive in which that player takes part, even if they are not on the pitch at the end of the Drive, that player is placed in the Knocked-out box of the Dugout as the magic of the Elves sends them into a confused stupor! |
| 8 | **Aquitaine:** Walking on the expertly cultivated grasslands and pitches of Aquitaine feels like walking on air. When a player trips and Falls Over due to Rushing, no Injury roll is made. The player is placed Prone and a Turnover occurs as normal. |

### Bretonnia Weather Table

| 2D6 | Result |
|----|--------|
| 2 | **Wildflower Fields:** The flower-filled meadows of Bretonnia lead to high pollen count, causing havoc for those afflicted with allergies! At the end of a Coach's Turn, the Coach randomly selects one of their players that is on the pitch. That player becomes Distracted. |
| 3 | **Enchanted Mist:** The lakes of Bretonnia are often inexplicably covered with magical mists that sometimes spread across neighbouring lands. When a player makes a Pass Action, they may only attempt to make a Quick Pass or a Short Pass. In addition, all players apply a -1 modifier to the test whenever they attempt to Rush. |
| 4-10 | **Perfect Conditions:** Not too hot, not too cold. It's perfect weather for Blood Bowl! There is no additional effect. |
| 11 | **Pouring Rain:** The heavens have opened and the sudden downpour has left the players soaked and the ball rather slippery! Whenever a player attempts to pick up or Catch the ball, or Intercept a Pass Action, they suffer a -1 modifier to the roll. |
| 12 | **A Bit Nippy:** The sun is shining but the air is rather chilly; sitting by the fireside seems an attractive prospect! Apply a -1 modifier when rolling to see if a player recovers from being Knocked-out. |

### Bretonnia Kick-off Event Table

| 2D6 | Result |
|----|--------|
| 2 | **That Peasant Is Revolting:** A peasant has left the watching nobles quite aghast by dashing onto the pitch absent of clothes, and great rewards are offered to those who catch him. Both Coaches randomly select one of their players on the pitch, then roll a D6 and add the MA value of that player to the result. The Coach with the highest total immediately gains a free Team Re-roll for the duration of the Drive, while the player selected by the losing Coach is immediately Placed Prone and becomes Stunned. In the result of a tie, both Coaches' selected players are immediately Placed Prone and become Stunned. |
| 3 | **Local Delicacies:** Platters of the dukedom's cuisine were handed around to the teams, much to their gastric distress. Both Coaches randomly select one of their players without the [Loner] (X+) Trait. Those players gained the [Projectile Vomit] Trait until the end of the Drive. |
| 4 | **Moment of Glory:** Who becomes a hero is often determined by who hits first! The Coach of the kicking team randomly selects one of their players that is Marking an opposition player. The chosen player must immediately perform a Block action against an opposition player; the player gains the [Dauntless] Skill while performing this action. This will not cause a Turnover. |
| 5 | **High Kick:** Apply the High Kick result as normal. |
| 6 | **Cheering Fans:** Apply the Cheering Fans result as normal. |
| 7 | **Brilliant Coaching:** Apply the Brilliant Coaching result as normal. |
| 8 | **Changing Weather:** Make a new roll on the Bretonnia Weather table and apply that result. If the result is 'Perfect Conditions' the ball will Scatter (3) before it lands. |
| 9 | **Quick Snap:** Apply the Quick Snap result as normal. |
| 10 | **Charge!:** Apply the Charge! result as normal. |
| 11 | **Joust!:** Stadium timetables have been mixed-up and a Knight is determined to start their 'scheduled' joust - irrespective of the game going on! Both Coaches randomly select one of their players on the pitch and roll a D6. On a 2+, the player is knocked down by the horse and is immediately Placed Prone and becomes Stunned. On a 1, the player is lanced by the Knight; place the player in the Knocked-out box. |
| 12 | **The Wild Hunt:** The scent of fresh blood has got the local Wood Elves convinced a Wild Hunt has been called. The Kicking Team's Coach rolls a D3. Both Coaches then randomly select that many players on the pitch. The selected players are immediately Placed Prone and become Stunned. |

## Bretonnian Courtyard Blood Bowl Pitch

The richest nobles of Bretonnia make their homes in the many castles that dot the land, the courtyards of which have been converted into Blood Bowl pitches where Knightly teams train. These courtyards are the beating heart of Bretonnia's sporting scene, carefully tended to by groundskeepers who are swiftly heartbroken the complete lack of care Blood Bowl Players take in preserving the landscape.

The Bretonnian Courtyard Pitch has two sides - one depicting the courtyard at the start of the game and the other having been subjected to a bombardment by the angry locals! If both Coaches agree, the following rules can be used to represent the unusual pitch conditions:

**Castle Courtyard:** Whenever an Armour Roll is made for a player that is Knocked Down, apply a +1 modifier to the roll. Additionally, at the end of the first half, flip the board over onto the Ruined Splendour side, as the downtrodden peasant masses ignite a riot that spills over onto the pitch.

**Ruined Splendour:** Players apply a -1 modifier to test whenever they attempt to Rush. In addition, if a player is Stalling at the end of their activation, do not roll to see if the Crowd Takes Action - it automatically does, as a large rock lands on the hesitating player's head!

## Bretonnian Balls

**Ornate Ball**

If a player that started their activation with an Ornate Ball ends their turn still in possession of it, roll a D6. On a roll of 1, the player becomes Distracted, as they try to figure out the secrets of the work of art in their hands.

**Blessed Ball**

A player gains the [Steady Footing] Skill, and [My Ball] and [Loner] (2+) Traits while they have possession of the Blessed Ball. In addition, they gain the [Foul Appearance] Skill while in possession of the Blessed Ball, on account of the shining holy light they are infused with.

## Special Rules and Achievements

You can make your game even more exciting by using the following special rules and achievements. There are three achievements per team that you can try to accomplish, which serve as a great tiebreaker - if the game ends in a draw, then the team that has completed the most achievements is the winner. Can you get all three and still lead your team into the annals of Blood Bowl history?

### Special Rules

**Don't Think They're Bretonnians!:** How do you know when a Bretonnian is not a Bretonnian? When they bite you, of course!

In the second half, Grail Knights gain the [Hatred] (Vampire) Trait.

**Ramshackle Stadium:** Mousillon isn't the most affluent of Dukedoms and the stadium reflects this, especially the boggy ground that is churned up into a quagmire.

When a player attempts to Rush and a 2 is rolled, the player's activation immediately ends - they will have still moved into the new square first.

**Tough Stock:** The Thralls of Mousillon are a hardy lot and they take their duty seriously; they'll not let a little biting keep them down!

The first three times a Thrall is Knocked-out as a result of the [Bloodlust] (X+) special rule, they are placed in the Reserve box of the Dugout rather than the Knocked-out section.

### Achievements

#### Brionne Barons

**No Beast Too Fierce:** Have the Varghiest suffer a Casualty or be Knocked-out as a result of a Block Action performed by a Grail Knight.

**Punch Up!:** Have Pierre the Ill-tempered perform a Block action against a Vampire Thrower or Vampire Blitzer and break the opposition player's armour.

**A Pair of Heroes:** Score a Touchdown with both Marguerite the Bold and Gaston of Brionne.

#### Mousillon Gnashers

**Thirsty Work:** Cause at least three Casualties against Thralls as a result of a failed [Bloodlust] (X) roll.

**Look Into My Eyes:** Have at least three opposition players Distracted due to the [Hypnotic Gaze] Trait at the same time.

**Quick as a Bat:** Have a player pass three or more Dodge rolls in a single activation.
