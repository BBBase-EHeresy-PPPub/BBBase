Player Down:
 
The active 
player is immediately Knock

attempting to block.
n
Both Down:
 
Both the active 
player and the target of the 
Block action are Knock
ed down 
by one another
. If one or both 
of the players has the Block 
skill, they may choose to ignore 
this result and not be Knock
ed 
down
.
j
Push Back:
 
The target of the 
Block action is pushed back 
one square by the active player
. 
The active player may follow 
up into the vacated square.
m
Stumble:
 
If the target of the 
Block action has and chooses 
to use the Dodge skill, this 
result becomes a P
ush Back. 
Other
wise, this result becomes 
a POW!
l
POW!:
 
The target of the Block 
action is pushed back by 
the active player and is then 
Knock
ed Down in the square 
they have been moved into
. 
The active player may follow 
up into the vacated square.
STRENGTH
When an active player performs a Block 
action, the first thing to do is compare the 
Strength characteristic of both players, 
including any modifiers.
 
1. Armour Roll: 
An Armour roll is made as described on p.29, by the coach 
of the opposing team. If the player
’s armour is ‘broken’, an Injury roll is made. 
If their armour is not broken
, it protects them from harm.
2. Injury Roll: 
Whenever a player
’s armour is broken, an Injur
y roll is made 
against them. The coach of the opposing team rolls
2D6 and consults the table below
.
RISKING INJURY
W
henever
 a player is Knocked Down or F
alls Over
, they risk injur
y
. 
When a player is Knocked Down or F
alls Over
, the coach of the 
opposing team will make an Armour roll against that player
.
FOULING
S
o 
you got the player knocked down
, but what about making them stay 
down? T
o make a F
oul action, the F
ouling player may move adjacent to 
a Knocked Down player and mak
e an Armour roll (possibly followed by 
an Injur
y roll). If a natural double is rolled when making either roll, the referee 
has seen the player committing the F
oul action and is Sent-
off and a T
urnover 
occurs as described on p.63.
The number of dice rolled depends on the 
strengths of the two players involved. No 
matter how many dice are rolled, only one is 
ever used to decide the result of the block.
k
Player Down:
 
The active 
player is immediately Knocked 
Down by the player they were 
attempting to block.
n
Both Down:
 
Both the active 
player and the target of the 
Block action are Knocked down 
by one another
. If one or both 
of the players has the Block 
skill, they may choose to ignore 
this result and not be Knocked 
down.
j
Push Back:
 
The target of the 
Block action is pushed back 
one square by the active player
. 
The active player may follow 
up into the vacated square.
m
Stumble:
 
If the target of the 
Block action has and chooses 
to use the Dodge skill, this 
result becomes a P
ush Back. 
Otherwise, this result becomes 
a POW!
l
POW!:
 
The target of the Block 
action is pushed back by

they have been moved into. 
The active player may follow

PASS ACTION
Once per team turn, a player on the active team 
may perform a P
ass action in order to pass the ball 
to another square, as described on page 48. A P
ass 
action involves moving up to the players MA, and 
then attempting a P
ass action.
1. Measure r
ange and declare tar
get square: 
The range ruler is used to measure the range to any
possible target squares before the target square is 
chosen and declared.
2. T
est for accuracy:
The coach of the player performing the action rolls 
a D6 to determine the accuracy of the pass.
3. P
assing inter
f
erence:
Unless the pass was fumbled, one opposition 
player may be able to attempt to interfere with the 
pass, hoping to ‘Deflect’ or ‘Intercept’ it.
4. Resolve pass: 
If the pass was neither fumbled nor interfered with, 
the pass itself is resolved!
Once per team turn, a player on the active team may
attempt to hand the ball off to another Standing 
player from their team that is in an adjacent square, 
as described on page 51.
HAND OFF
Once per team turn, instead of performing a P
ass 
action, a player on the active team with the ‘Throw
T
eam-mate’ trait can attempt to throw a victi... uh... 
team-mate with the ‘Right Stuff
’ trait as if they were 
a ball, as described on page 52.
