Get the Ref: 
Each team gains a free Bribe Inducement as 
described on p.91 of the Blood Bowl rulebook. This Inducement 
must be used before the end of the game or it is lost. 
3 
Time-out: 
If the kicking team™s turn marker is on turn 6, 7 or 
8 for the half, both coaches move their turn marker back one 
space. Otherwise, both coaches move their turn marker forward 
one space. 
4 
Solid Defence: 
D3+3 Open players on the kicking team may 
be removed and set-up again in different locations, following all 
of the usual set-up rules. 
5 
High Kick: 
 One Open player on the receiving team may be 
moved any number of squares, regardless of their MA, and 
placed in the same square the ball will land in. 
6 
Cheering Fans: 
 Both coaches roll a D6 and add the number 
of cheerleaders on their Team Draft list. The coach with the 
highest total may immediately roll once on the Prayers to Nuffle 
table. In the case of a tie, neither coach rolls on the Prayers 
to Nuffle table. Note that if you roll a result that is currently in 
effect, you must re-roll it. However, if you roll a result that has 
been rolled previously but has since expired, there is no need to 
re-roll it. 
7 
Brilliant Coaching: 
 Both coaches roll a D6 and add the 
number of Assistant Coaches on their Team Draft list. The coach 
with the highest total gains one extra team re-roll for the drive 
ahead. If this team re-roll is not used before the end of this 
drive, it is lost. In the case of a tie, neither coach gains an extra 
team re-roll.

Changing Weather: 
 Make a new roll on the Weather table 
and apply that result. If the weather conditions are ‚Perfect 
Conditions™ as a result of this roll, the ball will scatter, as 
described on p.25, before landing. 
9 
Quick Snap: 
 : D3+3 Open players on the receiving team may 
immediately move one square in any direction. 
10

 D3+3 Open players on the kicking team may 
immediately activate to perform a Move action. One may 
perform a Blitz action and one may perform either a Pass or 
Throw Team-mate action. If a player Falls Over or is Knocked 
Down, no further players can be activated and the Blitz ends 
immediately. 
11 
Officious Ref: 
 Both coaches roll a D6 and add their Fan Factor 
to the result. The coach that rolls the lowest randomly selects 
one of their players from among those on the pitch. In the case 
of a tie, both coaches randomly select a player. Roll a D6 for the 
selected player(s). On a roll of 2+, the player and the referee 
argue and have come to blows. The player is Placed Prone 
and becomes Stunned. On a roll of 1 however, the player is 
immediately Sent-off, as described on p.

1. 
12 
Pitch Invasion: 
 Both coaches roll a D6 and add their Fan 
Factor to the result. The coach that rolls the lowest randomly 
selects D3 of their players from among those on the pitch. In the 
case of a tie, both coaches randomly select D3 of their players 
from among those on the pitch. All of the randomly selected 
players are Placed Prone and become Stunned.

BLOCKING 
PLAYERS 
BLOCK DICE 
STRENGTH 
When an active player performs a Block 
action, the first thing to do is compare the 
Strength characteristic of both players, 
including any modifiers. 

1. Armour Roll: 
An Armour roll is made as described on p.29, by the coach 
of the opposing team. If the player™s armour is ‚broken™, an Injury roll is made. 
If their armour is not broken, it protects them from harm. 

1. Injury Roll: 
Whenever a player™s armour is broken, an Injury roll is made 
against them. The coach of the opposing team rolls 
2D6 and consults the table below. 
RISKING INJURY 
W 
henever 
 a player is Knocked Down or Falls Over, they risk injury. 
When a player is Knocked Down or Falls Over, the coach of the 
opposing team will make an Armour roll against that player. 
FOULING 
S 
o 
you got the player knocked down, but what about making them stay 
down? To make a Foul action, the Fouling player may move adjacent to 
a Knocked Down player and make an Armour roll (possibly followed by 
an Injur y roll). If a natural double is rolled when making either roll, the referee 
has seen the player committing the Foul action and is Sent-off and a Turnover 
occurs as described on p.

1. 
The number of dice rolled depends on the 
strengths of the two players involved. No 
matter how many dice are rolled, only one is 
ever used to decide the result of the block. 
k 
Player Down: 

The active 
player is immediately Knocked 
Down by the player they were 
attempting to block. 
n 
Both Down: 

Both the active 
player and the target of the 
Block action are Knocked down 
by one another. If one or both 
of the players has the Block 
skill, they may choose to ignore 
this result and not be Knocked 
down. 
j 
Push Back: 

The target of the 
Block action is pushed back 
one square by the active player. 
The active player may follow 
up into the vacated square. 
m 
Stumble: 

If the target of the 
Block action has and chooses 
to use the Dodge skill, this 
result becomes a Push Back. 
Otherwise, this result becomes 
a POW! 
l 
POW!: 

The target of the Block 
action is pushed back by 
the active player and is then 
Knocked Down in the square 
they have been moved into. 
The active player may follow 
up into the vacated square. 
STANDING UP 
S 
o 
you got knocked down, but what about getting back up again? The 
only time a player can Stand Up is at the beginning of an Action at a cost 
of three squares of movement. If a player has less than three squares of 
movement, they must roll 4+ to stand up. 
If the player stands up sucessfully, then they may not move further squares 
unless they Rush.

PASS ACTION 
Once per team turn, a player on the active team 
may perform a Pass action in order to pass the ball 
to another square, as described on page 

1. A Pass 
action involves moving up to the players MA, and 
then attempting a Pass action. 

1. Measure range and declare target square: 
The range ruler is used to measure the range to any 
possible target squares before the target square is 
chosen and declared. 

1. Test for accuracy: 
The coach of the player performing the action rolls 
a D6 to determine the accuracy of the pass. 

1. Passing inter ference: 
Unless the pass was fumbled, one opposition 
player may be able to attempt to interfere with the 
pass, hoping to ‚Deflect™ or ‚Intercept™ it. 

1. Resolve pass: 
If the pass was neither fumbled nor interfered with, 
the pass itself is resolved! 
Once per team turn, a player on the active team may 
attempt to hand the ball off to another Standing 
player from their team that is in an adjacent square, 
as described on page 

1. 
HAND OFF 
Once per team turn, instead of performing a Pass 
action, a player on the active team with the ‚Throw 
Team-mate™ trait can attempt to throw a victi... uh... 
team-mate with the ‚Right Stuff™ trait as if they were 
a ball, as described on page
