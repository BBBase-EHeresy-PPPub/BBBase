This weighty task saw the aforementioned Dwarf, Roze-El, become known as the sacred commissioner and the father of modern Blood Bowl - to the Dwarfs, anyway!

The game is designed to be played in good faith between players who respect each other, and players should treat each other as such. You'll find that if you keep the spirit of kindness and fair play in mind, you can resolve almost any instance of disagreement without issue.</p> <p>If, however, you find that you and your opponent cannot come to an agreement upon the application of the rules, or another situation, simply roll a D6 to determine whose interpretation of the rules will be used for the duration of the game.

More Star Players can be found in the Star Players PDF on warhammer-community.com, and some may appear in future Blood Bowl publications.</p> <p>Each Star Player has its own profile, complete with all of the Characteristics, Skills and Traits that they possess. The profile will also have a 'Plays For' section, which will list one or more of the Leagues &amp; Traits Star Players can play for.</p> <p>Star Players can only play for teams that have the same League as them. In some situations, a Star Player may not have a League listed, and may have a special rule listed instead. In these situations, the Star Player can only play for a team that also has that special rule.</p> <p>Example one: Griff Oberwald can play for teams from the Old World Classic, and so a team must have chosen the Old World Classic League when their Team Roster was drafted in order to hire Griff Oberwald.</p> <p>Example two: A Star Player with the Favoured of Khorne special rule can only play for teams that have the Favoured of Khorne special rule, and not those that have chosen any other type of Favoured of... such as Nurgle or Slaanesh.</p> <p>Each Star Player profile will also have a cost in gold pieces that a team must pay to hire them, as well as their own unique special rule that they can use during the game.</p> <p>In League Play, Star Players can be hired as Inducements as described on page 142.

It will also have the Leagues that the team can choose from, as well as any special rules that the team has. The Team Roster will also state how many gold pieces the team's Team Re-rolls will cost, and whether or not the team can take an Apothecary.</p> <p>Currently there are 29 different Team Rosters, each representing a different race and faction within the world of Blood Bowl.

When this is the case, you will need to choose which of them your team is from and note it down on your Team Draft List. This will impact which Star Players and Inducements your team can purchase. For example, an Ogre team has the choice of either Badlands Brawl or Worlds Edge Superleague and so a Coach taking an Ogre team will need to decide which of the two Leagues their Ogre team is from.</p> <p>In some instances, choosing a particular League may also provide additional special rules to the team. For example, a Norse team has the choice of either Old World Classic or Chaos Clash.
