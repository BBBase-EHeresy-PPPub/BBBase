[\< here are many different variations of Blood Bowl played in the Old
World, but perhaps the strangest is that of Dungeon Bowl. For years,
Wizards and spellcasters have been embroiled in much debate about which
of their Colleges of Magic is the greatest, and Dungeon Bowl is used as
a different, yet exciting, way of attempting to settle the matter
without involving the general population (who often end up worse off
when Wizards cannot agree!).](http://www.games-workshop.com)

[***DUNGEON TILES:*** These are the tiles that are used to create the
dungeon where the teams will play a game of Dungeon Bowl. They can be
arranged in a selection of different ways, allowing players to create
numerous different dungeon layouts for the games. ***TWO TEAM
DUGOUTS:*** These are used to keep track of game information, such as
which players are ready to enter the dungeon, if any players are Knocked
Out or Injured, and the number of re-rolls a team has
remaining.](http://www.games-workshop.com)

[***TWO DUNGEON BOWL TEAMS:*** There are eight different Colleges of
Magic, each with their own selection of miniatures that can be used.
Often teams will be made up of multiple races and positions, leading to
some rather unusual combinations being
possible!](http://www.games-workshop.com)

[***CHEST:*** These are placed around the dungeon, and could contain
either the ball or a booby trap, making for an exciting and
unpredictable game!](http://www.games-workshop.com)

[***PORTALS:*** These are placed throughout the dungeon and act as a way
for players to attempt to quickly navigate the dungeon, and for teams to
add more players to the dungeon as the game goes
on.](http://www.games-workshop.com)

[***DICE:*** Dungeon Bowl uses a selection of different types of dice:
regular six-sided dice, block dice, eight-sided dice and 16-sided dice
to bring the action to life.](http://www.games-workshop.com)

[***MEASURERS & TEMPLATES:*** These are used for passing the ball,
determining how a ball bounces, and so
on.](http://www.games-workshop.com)

[***THIS RULEBOOK:*** The one you are holding right now! This has all
the information you need to play the game of Dungeon Bowl, as well as
having the rosters for each of the eight Colleges of Magic so you can
start planning your teams right away!](http://www.games-workshop.com)

[After the ball has been recovered from one of the chests, when not in
the possession of a player (i.e., when being held and carried by a
player), the football or, more simply, the ball, is placed on the
ground, wholly within one otherwise empty square. When in a player\'s
possession, it will occupy a place on or adjacent to the base of that
model.](http://www.games-workshop.com)

there are a great many ways in which it can be represented, from a
simple token to a painted and based model, the rival of any

[**ore going further, it is worth establishing some general principles
regarding some commonly used terms, dice and the game of Dungeon Bowl in
general.**](http://www.games-workshop.com)

[**THE COACH AND THE PLAYERS**](http://www.games-workshop.com)

[**ungeon Bowl** is a tabletop game and tabletop games are traditionally
played by \'players'. But Dungeon Bowl is also a game that represents a
sporting](http://www.games-workshop.com)

[fixture rather than a battle between rival armies. Whilst in other
tabletop games the models might represent warriors, in Dungeon Bowl the
models represent sports players. To avoid confusion, and to adhere to
the theme of the game, the rules will always refer to the models as
'players' and to you, the person rolling the dice and making the
decisions, as the 'coach'. In addition, players that belong to the same
team are referred to as 'team-mates\', whilst players that do not belong
to their team are referred to as 'opposition
players'.](http://www.games-workshop.com)

[**[TAKE-BACKS AND CHANGING ONE'S
MIND]{.underline}**](http://www.games-workshop.com)

[It is not uncommon for coaches to second-guess themselves occasionally,
saying they are about to do something before immediately changing their
mind. As a general rule, you should be tolerant of this in your
opponents, as you will likely do it yourself - after all, we are playing
a game and games should be fun and enjoyable for all! However, once dice
have been rolled for any reason, you must abide by

[**[THE TURNOVER]{.underline}**](http://www.games-workshop.com)

[**O**ne of the most important mechanics of the game of Dungeon Bowl is
the 'Turnover'. Many unfortunate events will cause the active team's
turn to end prematurely with a Turnover, regardless of how many players
have been activated.](http://www.games-workshop.com)

[A Turnover is caused:](http://www.games-workshop.com)

-   
-   
-   
-   
-   
-   
-   
-   
-   

[If a player on the active team Falls Over during their own
activation.If a player on the active team is Knocked Down during their
team turn.If a player on the active team that is in possession of the
ball is Placed Prone during their team turn.If a player on the active
team attempts to pick up the ball from the ground and fails, even if the
bouncing ball is then caught by a player from the active team.If a
player on the active team fumbles a Pass action, even if the bouncing
ball is then caught by a player from the active team.If no player on the
active team catches the ball after a Pass action or a Hand-off action
and the ball comes to rest on the ground or in the possession of a
player from the opposition team.If a Pass action is Deflected or
Intercepted and the ball comes to rest either on the ground or in the
possession of a player from the opposition team.If a player on the
active team that is in possession of the ball is thrown by a team-mate
and either fails to land safely, or is eaten, even if the bouncing ball
is then caught by a player from the active team.If a player on the
active team is Sent-off by the referee for committing a Foul.This list
is not exhaustive; there may be other events that will cause a Turnover.
Where this is the case, these will be detailed by the
rules.](http://www.games-workshop.com)

[Should a Turnover occur, any dice rolls that must be made as a result
of the event that caused it are made immediately, after which the
current player's activation ends. The active team may not activate any
more players and the current team turn
ends.](http://www.games-workshop.com)

[*For example, should one of your players Fall Over whilst moving, an
Armour roll is made against them. If that player was in possession of
the ball, the ball will then bounce. Once the ball has come to rest, the
player\'s activation ends and you may activate no more players this
turn. Finally, your team turn ends and the opposition team becomes the
active team.*\

been rolled.](http://www.games-workshop.com)

[**OPENING CHESTS**](http://www.games-workshop.com)

[**ack** *when the game of Dungeon Bowl was first invented, the
Magisterium realised that they would need to tweak some of the more
traditional rules of Blood Bowl to suit the more unique setting of the
dungeon and to add that extra bit of excitement to the game. One of*
these changes was to *remove the usual kick-off; it wouldn't really work
with* the *low ceilings in many rooms of the
dungeon.*](http://www.games-workshop.com)

[*Instead, a number of identical chests are placed around the dungeon*
that the *players will need to locate. One of these chests will include
the all- important football; however, the others are fitted with a
spectacular, though (usually) non-lethal, magical spell that will
explode in the face of whoever* should *open
it!*](http://www.games-workshop.com)

[Players may not move over a Chest, it is essentially an impassible
feature that does not block Line of Sight. A player that finishes a Move
action (but not as part of a Blitz action) in a square adjacent to a
Chest, and who is not Marked \'when they finish their Move action, may
choose to open the Chest. When a Player opens a Chest, remove the lid of
the model to see what is inside.](http://www.games-workshop.com)

[\'f the Chest contains the football, then the player immediately gains
Possession of the ball and their activation ends immediately. The Chest
is - removed from play and the square it was in becomes a normal

[**Unlike games played In a league, exhibition \^ are not linked,
Therefore players will not have the opportunity to earn and spend Star
Player point/ In the same way, However, teams drafted for exhibition
play should Include more than just rookies - having a few players with
an extra Skill or two makes for a more Interesting game, To allow for
this, exhibition teams are granted a number of SPP to distribute between
players, meaning that some players can be given advancements when the
team Is drafted.**](http://www.games-workshop.com)

[**[FREE SPP]{.underline}** How many SPP coaches have to distribute
between their players varies. For example, you could grant each team 36
SPP to spend on advancements; this is a fair number and allows a good
selection of advancements across a team.](http://www.games-workshop.com)

[However, this is only a guideline, and the number can be increased or
decreased as desired. More SPP will enable more player advancements,
fewer SPP will obviously allow for fewer player
advancements.](http://www.games-workshop.com)

[If two coaches are drafting teams for exhibition play between
themselves, they should take a few minutes to determine how many SPP
they will have first. Tournament organisers should decide how many SPP
