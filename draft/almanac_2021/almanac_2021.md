 [**A**nother year, another Almanac, and another special  editorial where you get the best that Spike! Publications  has to offer - that's me, of course! Yes, I know, you all look  forward to my well-crafted writings each year, and who can blame  you? After all, I am the greatest Blood Bowl star turned writer  there is! Over the last year, here at *Spike! Journal* we have
 strived  to provide you with the very best content we can. Our writers  have been specially motivated to produce the highest quality  writing possible. How, you ask? Well, let's just say that none of  them fancy taking me on in an arm wrestling
 contest!]

[![](almanac_2021/media/image4.png) 
 ]

 [nyway, enough about me -  for now anyway! Over the  past couple of years, the]

[staff at *Spike! Journal* have been all across the known world, putting their wellbeing at risk, in order to collect the top stories, team exposes and interviews for your enjoyment. So, where have they been off to?]

[We start with a trip to Sylvania, and our staff digging up the dirt on the recently resurrected in the form of Necromantic Horror teams. Whilst not all of our staff returned from this adventure (in fact, I hear that one of them is actually forging a great career as the left arm of a Flesh Golem for the Crimson Cadavers), those who did came back with some particularly juicy tidbits. Spotlights on Frank 'n' Stein, Wilhelm Chaney and Bryce \'the Slice' Cambuel, and a ghoulishly gruesome edition of Coffin Corner prove to be just some of this issue's highlights.]

[After this, we split our staff in two (not literally, of course!), and sent half to the Empire to liaise with]

[the Imperial Nobility, whilst those who drew the short Snotlings had to go to the Badlands and try not to get beaten up by the belligerent Black Orcs - which is easier said than done! This issue also focussed on two stars nearly as good as me\... nearly: Griff Oberwald and Varag Ghoul-Chewer. On top of that, Mindy Piewhistle investigated rumours of corruption in the Empire, and Hackspit Quillchewer interviewed an Orc bodybuilding fanatic in Chat with the Rat.]

[The final issue in this year's *Almanac* focuses upon the bloodthirsty Khorne teams and the sheer amount of wonderful carnage they can dish out. I remember playing for a Khornate team one time. Lovely chaps, but they seemed to have no interest in winning and simply wanted to punch anything that moved. Don't get me wrong, I love a good punch-up (just ask the staff in the post room), but I do like to make sure it leads to winning the game - I have a reputation to look out for, after all!]

[*Spike! Journal.* As always, if you have any questions or woes for me to read, write them down and send them to the usual place. I do enjoy a good laugh!]

[[OTPS OF THE GAME]]

 [**Star Players are, perhaps, the most exciting  thing about Blood Bowl. True legends and  pioneers of the modern sport who have  excelled in multiple aspects of Nuffle's sacred  game. Whether it be as a game-winning scorer  of many glorious touchdowns like Griff Oberwald  or Hakflem Skuttlespike, a catastrophic casualty  causer such as Varag Ghoul-Chewer or Morg 'n'  Thorg, or a crowd-pleasing maniac like Helmut  Wulf or Akhorne the Squirrel, Star Players come  in all shapes and sizes.**]

[T][he aim of an All-Star Game is to
allow players to field as many of their collection of Star Players as they want, creating a unique gaming experience that couldn't be achieved in a regular Blood Bowl game or league. Not only will this result in a truly spectacular match (these are the best players around after all!), but it will also mean that Star Players that could never normally be used in the same team can take to the gridiron alongside each other as a one-off - probably to try to prove which of them is really the better player *(Lord Borak, of course\... - EdY*]

[This is the perfect excuse for coaches to field their favourite Star Players all at the same time and see what wacky and unpredictable combinations they can come up with. It also allows seasoned coaches to try out a number of different Star Players they have been considering hiring for their own teams. That way, they can get a good feel for multiple Star Players in one go. You never know, you may find a new favourite Star Player to hire during your next league season!]

[Over the next few pages we explain everything you need to know to start playing your very own All-Star Games. From drafting your rosters of Star Players to any extra rules that are required when playing an All-Star Game. There are also two set rosters of Star Players to use to recreate the inaugural Cabalvision All-Star Spectacular from the year 2500. Enjoy!]

[ ]

[**\| [ALL-STAR ROSTERS]**]

 [T][he most important thing that
 coaches need to sort  out before they begin an All-Star Game is who  gets to use which Star Players. After all, a
 Star]

 [Player can only play for one team at a time,- they may be  exceptional players but even they can't be in two places  at once!]

 [There are two methods you can use in order to  decide your All-Star rosters: the Random Method and the  Drafting Method. Both are fairly simple, but each will  likely give a different style of All-Star
 team.]

[An All-Star roster may only ever have a maximum of 16 players, though coaches may decide to have fewer Star Players if they wish.]

[**RANDOM METHOD**]

[The Random Method works exactly how it sounds - completely randomly! Coaches should place the names of all the Star Players into a hat, helmet, or other suitable container, and then alternate drawing them one at a time to make up their rosters.]

[Star Players that come as a pair, such as the Swift Twins or Grak & Crumbleberry, should be part of the same draw - that way coaches draw both of them at the same time. If a coach draws Star Players that come as a pair, the next coach may make two draws (unless their first draw also picks a pair of Star Players) to even up the numbers.]

[If a coach draws a pair of Star Players when they only have one space left on their roster, they can choose to either re-draw, or place one of their other picks back into the hat to take the pair of Star
Players.]

[This continues until all the Star Players have been drawn or until coaches have full
rosters.]

[The Random Method is more likely to produce less even teams as coaches have little to no control over the Star Players they get. If you prefer playing with the hand that is dealt, or simply want to let the almighty Nuffle determine your fate, this might be the method for
you!]

[![](almanac_2021/media/image7.jpeg) 
 ]

[**MFTINC METHOD**]

 [\twW Method is more likely to result ~ln~ baileed\~  as coaches take it in turns to pick a Star
 P\|~ayer~]

[\ best suits their needs at the time. Coaches roll a Ds . ~lltW~iling any ties) and the coach that rolls the
highest]

[gets the first pick,n\ the\ first draft
round.]

[In the first draft round, the coach who has the first pick may choose any Star Player for their team The oth coach may then choose any remaining star Player. I subsequent draft rounds, the coach who picked second in the previous draft round gets the first pick in that A . round. This process continues until all Star Players ar ■ selected or both coaches' rosters are full.
e]

[**RE-ROLLS AND OTHER**]

[**[ALL-STAR ROSTER ELEMENTS] **As an All-Star roster is not put together using gold pieces, there are certain elements that are different from a standard game. First off, there are no assistant coaches or cheerleaders for an All-Star roster-, these players are only playing together for this one game, after all! There are also no Dedicated Fans for an All-Star roster either; everyone who is in attendance simply wants to see an awesome game of Blood Bowl, and the fans will likely be cheering for both teams anyway!]

[Finally, and most importantly, we have re-rolls. Both teams in an All-Star game automatically start with three team re-rolls at the start of each half.]

[![](almanac_2021/media/image8.png) 
 ]

 [*For example: In the first draft round Rob has the  first pick, and he chooses Morg 'n' Thorg for his  team. Jay then chooses Deeproot Strongbranch. In  the second draft round it is Jay who has the first  pick, and he selects Varag Ghoul-Chewer. Rob then  chooses Mighty Zug for his team.*]

 [Star Players that come as a pair, such as the Swift  \'wins or Grak & Crumbleberry, must be selected  aether. Additionally, if a coach selects a pair of Star  \"layers then they forego their next pick in the draft to  ensure that the numbers remain evenly matched - unless  the other coach also selects a pair of Star
 Players.]

 [Coaches may not select a pair of Star Players if  toy only have one space remaining on their
 roster.]

 [The Drafting Method is far more likely to resu  dosely balanced teams as coaches can tactically seie  to best Star Player for their team during each dra  round based on the choices they have already ma  and those of their opponent.]

 [In either selection method, all Star Players s . ~es  ~available to be chosen from. However, if f~rorn  ~then they are free to exclude any Star ay  to selection process if they wish.]

[**[RULES DIFFERENCES]**]

[T][o help a game using only Star Players
run smoothly, and to add to the fun of this unique type of game, there are a few rules differences between an All-Star game and a regular game of Blood
Bowl.]

[Here we are going to run through all of these rules changes for an All-Star game.]

[**PRE-GAME SEQUENCE**]

[As you might expect, the pre-game sequence for an All- Star game is a bit different from a standard game; mainly as most of the steps are not required.]

[![](almanac_2021/media/image9.png) 
 When playing an All-Star game only step 2,
the Weather, and step 6, Determine Kicking Team, are used. As there is no Fan Factor, no Journeymen, no Inducements, and no Prayers to Nuffle (these players think they are Nuffle's gift to the sport already!), these steps are not used - allowing coaches to get playing as quickly as possible.]

[**[LONER]**]

[Star Players will usually all have the Loner (X+) trait. This is to represent them playing alongside a team that they may not be used to, one filled with rookie players, or simply believing themselves too skilled to warrant listening to the coach.]

[In an All-Star Game, every player on the pitch is a veteran of the sport who has played for years and racked up numerous accolades. To these players, the game of Blood Bowl is second nature and, even though they may not have played together before, their skills are great enough to do so almost effortlessly.]

[To represent this, in an All-Star game, all Star Players lose the Loner (X+) trait if they have
it.]

[**[STAR PLAYER POINTS]**]

[Star Players themselves do not generate Star Player Points during a game; they already have their Skills & Traits listed. As such, coaches do not need to record Star Player Points during the course of the game. Although it can be fun to keep a track of all this for fun; we're sure the players themselves would be keeping track for bragging rights anyway!]

[**INJURIES**]

[With an All-Star game being an exhibition match, if a player is removed from the pitch as a Casualty there is no need to roll to see what happens to them - they simply miss the rest of the game. Though it can be fun to see what would've happened to the player if the casualty had happened during a regular game!]

[**POST-GAME SEQUENCE**]

[As an All-Star game is simply an exhibition match, albeit a very important and lucrative one, there is no post-game sequence to go through. Simply acknowledge the result, shake hands, and discuss the game over a nice cup of tea or pint of Bloodweiser!]

[**"I've not seen this many stars on the pitch since my last run in with Varag Ghoul-Chewer!"**]

[*Bob Bifford at the first annual All Star Spectacular - 2500* ]

[THE INAUGURAL CABALVISION ALL-STAR SPEC[TA]CULAR \_]

[**I**][**n the year 2500 of the Imperial
Calendar, Cabalvision executives came up with an idea to boost ratings by creating an event showcasing the very best players to take to the gridiron that year. This was, of course, the All-Star Spectacular - and by Nuffie did it prove to be an outright
success!**]

 [Millions of fans of the game tuned in to witness these  living legends take to the field and to see their favourite  players team-up in ways that, until now, had only been a  dream match thought up by fans as a way to discuss who  is the best player of all time.]

 [The teams themselves were selected by none other  than legendary Cabalvision commentators, Jim Johnson  and Bob Bifford, giving the two storied sportscasters a  chance to earn their own bragging rights for the next
 year!]

 [The two rosters presented here depict the two teams  that participated in the inaugural Cabalvision All-Star  Spectacular, Jim Johnson's Juggernauts and Bob Bifford\'s  Bruisers, allowing two coaches to recreate this piece of  Blood Bowl history!]

[[SIGNING ON]]

[**Contracts. The huge scrolls of paper that detail a player\'s commitment to a team (and filled with microscopic small print, of course!) and outlines all the perks, benefits and added little extras they receive for performing well - and, on occasion, the measures taken should they underperform. Good performances on the pitch will often result in a much more lucrative deal being struck at the end of the season as the team strives to retain the services of their very best players. Though should the player fail to live up to expectations then they may soon find themselves cut from the team and looking for a new employer before the next season kicks off!**]

[However, it is not uncommon for Star Players to sign exclusively with a specific team for an entire season, receiving a contract that they simply cannot turn down - either through the amount of gold offered, or perhaps to ensure the team keeps a particular secret, well\... secret. Sometimes the chance of glory, and another trophy or accolade to add to their storied careers, is worth more than the gold promised for their services - after all, most Star Players have plenty of gold as it
is!]

[This section of *Spike! Presents 2021 Almanac! *outlines an additional way coaches can use Star Players during the course of a league, one where Star Players will sign exclusively for a certain team for the entire duration of the league. Not only will this allow for coaches to get even more use out of their favourite Star Players, but it will also allow for new rivalries to be formed and add an extra dimension to the already exciting game that is Blood Bowl!]

[**S**tar Players are no exception to this; the only real differences being the amount of gold pieces they are paid, and often the length of the contract
itself.]

[Many Star Players prefer to simply sign with a team for a single game, either to give the team a helping hand, or to have another crack against a specific opponent. These one-game contracts allow Stars Players to earn plenty
of]

[![](almanac_2021/media/image13.jpeg) 
 Over the next few pages, we outline exactly
how this works, detailing how coaches go about selecting their Star Players, how this affects things such as Team Value, what happens in subsequent seasons, and any other slight rules tweaks that are needed when using these rules for hiring Star Players in your leagues. ]

[**[DRAFTING YOUR TEAMS]**]

[**A**s with any other standard league, the first thing that each coach needs to do is draft their starting roster. This follows all the normal rules
for]

[drafting a Blood Bowl team as laid out on pages 30-35 of the *Blood Bowl* rulebook. Coaches have 1,000,000 gold pieces to spend on players, Sideline Staff, team re-rolls and so forth.]

[Once all coaches have written and submitted their team rosters, it is time to sign some Star
Players!]

[**SIGNING STAR PLAYERS**]

[At the start of the season, each team may sign a single Star Player to their roster. This does not cost any gold pieces; the cost is covered by the teams' owners and so the Star Player is essentially \'free\'.]

[However, as each Star Player is unique, once
they]

[have signed for a team they can only play for that
team]

[during the course of the season. As such, there needs to be a system for deciding which teams get the first chance to sign a Star Player - they can't sign for multiple teams, after all!]

[After all coaches have submitted their rosters, the League Commissioner should put all the participating team names into a hat, helmet, or other suitable receptacle, and then draw them out one-by-one. Once a team has been drawn, that team's coach may choose any Star Player that is eligible to play for their team to add to their roster. Once a Star Player has been selected, they may not be chosen by another team - they have already committed themselves to a team for the entirety of the season.]

[Once a Star Player has been selected by a team, that team's coach adds the Star Player to their team roster. Star Players hired in this way may never be fired from a team; the financial ramifications for a team to break their contract are far too great for them to risk terminating the contract early!]

[In the unlikely event that a team cannot choose any eligible Star Players, because every Star Player that could have played for their team has already been signed to another team, a coach may select any other currently unsigned Star Player, even if they could not normally play for their team. This may result in some strange combinations of teams and Star Players, though if we are honest, gold opens many doors in the world of Blood Bowl!]

[**[TEAM VALUE]**]

[Although teams do not need to pay any gold pieces to sign a Star Player in this manner, they will still contribute to a team's Team Value at the start of the season.
This]

[will mean that most teams will start the season with different Team Values based on the Star Player they have signed for the season. This is normal, and will result in some coaches getting a greater choice of Inducements from the very first game.]

[**UNSIGNED STAR PLAYERS**]

[Not every Star Player will be fortunate enough to be signed for the entire season, gaining that guaranteed game-time and pay cheque. Some will have to find games in the more traditional way, signing for one-off games for teams where they are needed the
most.]

[Star Players that were not signed to any team
are]

[still eligible to be hired by any team as Inducements
in]

[the usual way. To make it clear to all coaches which
Star]

[![](almanac_2021/media/image14.jpeg) 
 Players are able to be hired as
Inducements, the League Commissioner should have a list of these Star Players that is easily accessible to all
coaches.]

[**INJURIES**]

[Should a Star Player suffer a Casualty at any point during the course of the season, they will treat any results of a Serious Injury, Lasting Injury or DEAD as Seriously Hurt instead. This means that Star Players cannot suffer Niggling Injuries, Characteristic Reductions, or be killed during the course of the season; probably due to the expert medical care or protective spells they purchase with the large amounts of gold they earn through their lucrative contracts.]

[This means that Star Players will always be able to play at their best, and will not suddenly become significantly worse following a strong tackle - ensuring that coaches are always getting the most out of the Star Player they invested in at the start of the seas However, Star Players may still be forced to miss the team's next game if that tackle is particularly
bruta]

[**[STAR PLAYER POINTS]

[Star Players are all pretty wealthy, havingbuiit\]\j\\~- sums of gold from their playing careers, various contracts and the many sponsorship deals they are no doubt part of As a result, these players have access to the very best doctors, necromancers, shamans, or whatever their preferred method of medical care is, and can pay handsomely to ensure that their playing careers are not tragically cut short, or are not subjected to the likes of a sawbones or those practitioners who still believe in the healing powers of leeches\...]

[![](almanac_2021/media/image15.jpeg) 
 ]

[**[SUBSEQUENT SEASONS]**]

[**A**t the end of the season, all the Star Player\'s contracts will expire and coaches must remove them from their respective rosters. The next step is for all coaches to re-draft their teams ready for the new season as per the rules for re-drafting teams found on pages 99-100 of the *Blood Bowl* rulebook. Additionally, any new coaches that wish to join the league must draft their roster as normal at this point.]

[The next stage is for teams to sign a Star Player for the new season. This works slightly differently to how it did in the previous season; essentially, the lower down the league a team finished in the previous season, the earlier they get the chance to pick a Star Player for the upcoming season.]

[Firstly, any new teams joining the league get the first chance to sign an eligible Star Player for their team. The order that new coaches get to sign a Star Player is determined by a random draw in the same manner as explained earlier.]

[*For example: Nic, Sam and Luke all wish to join an ongoing league. After drafting their teams, they each need to sign a Star Player. The League Commissioner puts their name in a hat and draws them out one at a time. Sam comes out first and chooses Morg 'n' Thorg for his Halfling team. Nic's name comes out second, so he drafts Lord Borak for his Khorne team (a fine choice! - Ed). Finally, Luke chooses Roxanna Darknail for his Dark Elf
team.*]

[After all new teams have signed a Star Player, the existing teams now get their opportunity to sign one of the remaining Star Players. However, the order in which existing teams select a Star Player is not done at random as was done for the first season. Instead, all existing teams should be ranked according to how well they did in the previous season as if they had all been part of the same division. The team that is ranked last will get the first pick of the remaining Star Players, followed by the team that was ranked second to last, and so on until the team that was ranked highest gets the final
pick.]

[*For example: Continuing from our previous example, it is time for the existing teams to each draft a Star Player. After collating the results from the previous season, the standings are as follows:*]

[*Jay Necromantic Horror Gavin Skaven Shane Black Orc Xavier Wood Elf Keith Uzardmen James Elven Union Louise Goblin Steve Imperial Nobility Dan Shambling Undead Rob Ogre*]

[*After the new coaches have selected their Star Players, the next pick falls to Rob as his team finished bottom in the previous season. After Rob, it will be Dan, then Steve and so on. Rob selects Deeproot Strongbranch, Dan chooses Frank 'n' Stein, Steve drafts Mighty Zug, Louise chooses Varag Ghoul-Chewer, James takes the Swift Twins, Keith selects Zolcath the Zoat, Xavier drafts Gioriel Summerbloom, Shane takes the Black Gobbo, Gavin chooses Glart Smashrip, and finally Jay drafts Wilhelm Chaney.*]

[This is done to ensure that the team that won the previous season doesn't keep winning and to give all the other teams the best possible chance of evening the playing field for the upcoming season!]

[**A FAMILIAR FACE**]

[Playing with the same players week in and week out is sure to have an impact on a Star Player, making them more used to the tactics and playstyle employed by that team. As such, Star Players that sign for the same team in multiple seasons will be more accustomed to the way that team plays, and will fit in much
easier.]

[In subsequent seasons, if a team signs the same Star Player as it did in the previous season then that Star Player will lose the Loner (X+) trait for the duration of the season.]

[**O**ne such invention is the rather exciting \'Ballzooka\' which, in the hands of its inventor, Barik Farblast of Farblast & Sons Ordnance Solutions, has become quite the crowd pleaser in recent years - as well as quite a deadly weapon to boot! The Ballzooka itself is not much more than a shoulder-mounted cannon used to fire the ball truly impressive lengths down the pitch. However, it has to be said that this contraption isn't exactly legal according to the sacred laws of Nuffie, and when Barik first unveiled his now-infamous weaponry for the Grudge-Bearers, the Referees and Rulekeepers Guild (RARG) were left completely bemused as to how to deal with such a contraption!]

[Bank and his Ballzooka soon became a huge hit with supporters of the Grudge-Bearers, with fans cramming themselves into the stadium in the hope of witnessing one of Bank\'s legendary pitch-long passes. There are not many things that cause such rapturous cheering as Bank loading the ball into his Ballzooka, and launching it downfield for the game-winning touchdown - particularly if it is an Elf team on the receiving end of such a
defeat!]

[However, there has always been one small problem with Bank\'s tactics - aside from the fact that the Ballzooka\'s status as a secret weapon is widely known. The problem is that most Dwarfs aren't exactly known for being adept at the passing game and, as a result, even fewer Dwarfs have developed much of a catching game. It takes a great deal of practice for a player to master catching a pitch-long pass from a Ballzooka, though the results can be spectacular. The huge amount of force the ball is launched with does have its benefits, though, as opposition players foolish enough to attempt to intercept it will often find themselves left flat on their
backs!]

[After a number of years playing for the Grudge-Bearers, Bank decided to go freelance; playing for any teams that wanted to add some much needed fire-power to their ranks - so long as they paid handsomely for the privilege, of course! In 2498, Bank made his triumphant return to the Grudge-Bearers on a season-long deal and was instrumental in their campaign in the Blood Bowl. This saw the Grudge-Bearers lift their first Blood Bowl title, and earned Bank a coveted Blood Bowl Winner's
Medal.]

He returns a year later to an outraged Grudge-Bearers team who were not best pleased about his disappearance mid-season, though their anger soon dissipates when he unveils his wondrous Ballzooka.

[rowing up, Fungus was an entirely unremarkable Goblin; not possessed with any sort of desire to play Blood Bowl at all. In fact, Fungus spent ost of his younger years harvesting mushrooms
and]

[veloping a keen interest in the culinary arts. It was this ssion for cooking that would ultimately change Fungus o the crazed lunatic we all know and love today. Whilst lowing a recipe from 99 *Fabulous Fungus Superfoods, *ngus accidentally turned too many pages and bmed multiple helpings of madcap mushrooms into the same dish. With a single taste of his new concoction, Fungus descended into madness - flinging mushrooms across the kitchen and swinging his cooking pot around in a deadly arc!]

[Such a change in Fungus\' demeanour did not go unnoticed, and he was soon offered a contract with his local team, the Greenboyz, who had been on the lookout for a new Fanatic after their last one had accidentally throttled themself with their own chain. Although they couldn't understand the inane babbling coming from Fungus, the Greenboyz took it as a yes and quickly got him some new gear. Though it took months of training', the Greenboyz unveiled the newest signing in a match against the Norgnt Nosepickers. The
game]

[was eventually abandoned when Fungus splattered seven of the Nosepicker's starting line-up, ruined their Troll's chance of being a father, and careened into the McMurty\'s stand. The devastating spectacle was caught on Cabalvision, and soon Fungus was being offered all kinds of sponsorship deals. The incident is still shown on comedy clip-shows to this day!]

[Though it is Fungus\' love for madcap mushrooms that fuels his violence, it also dooms him to spend his entire life in a state of insanity, constantly twitching and muttering to himself whenever his favourite weapon is taken from him and clutching an imaginary chain. The moment his prized possession is returned to him Fungus begins swinging, levelling anything in his
path]

[In the world of Blood Bowl, Fungus the Loon has become a firm fan favourite His unique brand of insane violence often finds him talked about as amongst the most destructive players currently playing the game, and any game he features in is sure to have an extended highlights package focussing almost solely on whatever antics Fungus and his trusty ball and chain got up to during the match!]

Fungus\' debut a few months later is a roaring success, and the Greenboyz become the go-to name in the Underworld league for secret weapons and Goblin
insanity.]

The resulting collision is nothing short of spectacular; a fiery explosion flinging shards of metal high into the air!

**V** next door Blood Bowl stadium in the middle of **K** match between the Mayhem Gnashers and the Altdorf \'Acolytes. Just as the Acolytes were about to score an equalising touchdown, Dribblesnot landed on the ball carrier, causing the player to drop the ball and gifting the Gnashers the win. The Gnashers' fans let out a rapturous

cheer for Dribblesnot, who they assumed was a new player making his timely debut. Thrilled by the reception, Dnbblesnot accepted a contract from the Mayhem Gnashers, who were quick to approach their new-found hero with a deal.

Dnbblesnot struggled to make any kind of impression in his next few games, he hadn't exactly been trained in the art of Nuffle's sacred game as his colleagues had been. After being benched for a few games, Dnbblesnot began to day-dream about how he could make the best impact for his team. His thoughts wandering back to his days in the circus before a brainwave struck him - gunpowder! Bursting with excitement, Dnbblesnot approached head coach Th rug with an idea; provide him with a supply of bombs, have the team's Troll throw him through the air, and he'd drop these explosives on

the opposition. Impressed with the idea, Thrug allowed Dribblesnot to test his unique play in the next game - it wasn't as if Dribblesnot could get any worse!

The results were remarkable, as Dribblesnot wasted little time in getting the team\'s Troll to launch him over the opposition. Three bombs later and the opposition lines had scattered, and the Mayhem Gnashers had run through to score. The fans, who had yearned to see more of the Dribblesnot that had made such an impact in his 'debut, met this play with a thunderous cheer. Of course, this bomb-tastic action was entirely illegal and Dribblesnot was ejected from the game. However, the impact of the risk-taking Goblin won the hearts of the fans, and earned him the name of Bomber.

In the years that followed, Bomber Dnbblesnot has travelled around the Underworld leagues plying his trade; playing for any team that requires that explosive edge. Of course, he still often plays for the Mayhem Gnashers, but has also strode out onto the pitch alongside many teams both great and small. Bomber even played a single game for the Gouged Eye, though a misplaced bomb into the dugout has made him unwelcome in recent years'

**CAREER HIGHLIGHTS**

During a routine performance at Trollgut's Travelling Circus, an

enthusiastic trainee cannoneer fills the cannon with

slightly' more gunpowder than is recommended.

। he resulting explosion fires Dribblesnot out of the circus and into the next door Blood Bowl stadium mid-game, landing straight on the Altdorf Acolyte's star runner to prevent a touchdown and giving the victory to the Mayhem Gnashers. Dribblesnot is heralded as a hero by the fans and is quickly signed by the Gnashers.

**Ci Ci** During the semi-finals of the **• ■ W** Underworld Cup between the Mayhem Gnashers and the Sewer Pipe Scoundrels, Bomber tries to take down the opposition Rat Ogre with a full bag of bombs. The cluster of bombs all detonate simultaneously with an almighty explosion, causing the cave roof to collapse and crush numerous players from both sides. The game is abandoned, and an enquiry is launched to find the culprit. Fortunately for Bomber, the explosion seemed to originate from the Rat Ogre and the blame is placed solely on the Scoundrels!

In what is perhaps the greatest achievement of his career to date,

Bomber signs a one game deal with the Gouged Eye. Unfortunately, Bomber is rather nervous about playing for such a famous team, and he accidentally leaves a primed bomb in the Gouged Eye's dugout. The resulting explosion injures a number of Gouged Eye players, and distracts those on the pitch long enough for the Skavenblight Scramblers to score and knock the Gouged Eye out of the Blood Bowl. Unsurprisingly, Bomber is never hired by the Gouged Eye again.

-Do you mean playing practical jokes on our tutors, staying out late and drinking copious amounts of Blitzer\'s Best, Jim?"

-Ahem. Err, no, Bob. I am talking about Dungeon Bowl!\"

-Ah of course, Jim! I did love a bit of Dungeon Bowl in my youth; though I didn\'t get to play for very long of course, I was quickly scouted and snapped up to the big leagues you see\..."

"Yes, yes, Bob, but now isn't the time for you to reminisce. Our readers are here for their latest fix of collegiate carnage! Now, whilst most traditional games of Dungeon Bowl are played between two teams from different colleges\...\"

Well, it is a chaotic affair, Bob. Four teams, numerous chests, portals and traps, and one extra large dungeon to help contain them all!\"

"And that\'s certainly not easy, Jim! Keeping all these budding stars, and their fragile egos, in the dungeon can be tough. More than once has the fighting spilled out through a portal and into somewhere else in the college!\"

"It certainly is a great spectacle, Bob, and our employers over at Cabalvision have even got a few four-way college grudge matches for us to commentate on this season. I can't wait to get my fangs stuck into them!\"

"It's going to get messy, Jim. It\'s a race to find the ball hidden in a chest and then get it into any of the other team's end zones - without being bloodied along the way of course!"

"All this talk of blood is making me peckish, Bob.

But enough of that, it\'s time to play DUNGEON BOWL!\"

\'Or sometimes the same college, Jim."

\'Very true, Bob. But sometimes there is a score to settle

between more than two colleges; after all, college rivalries often know no bounds!"

"You\'re right there, Jim. I distinctly remember a squabble between Wizards from the colleges of Life, Fire, Heavens and Beasts where they decided to settle it with a four-way game of Dungeon Bowl. I still don't know who won that game though, Jim, in fact I heard that it caused the same Wizards to argue even more - this time over who the victors were!1

[MULTI-PLAYER MAYHEM]

 **Dungeon Bowl is, by its very nature,  a chaotic experience at the best of  times! Teams of hopeful varsity players  scurrying around an underground dungeon,  avoiding its various dangerous rooms and booby  traps in search of the all-important game ball -  and causing as much carnage along the way, of  course! This unique variation on Nuffle's sacred  game has long been used by the eight Colleges  of Magic as a way of settling disagreements  between the college Magisters, or simply as  a way for colleges to earn a bit more gold by  placing expensive wagers on the outcomes.**

**O**f course, games of Dungeon Bowl are usually played between two teams from different colleges - although the other college Wizards still take a keen interest in the results and place bets of course! However, there have been occasions where a particular argument, discussion, or simply a disagreement about which college is the best, grows to involve more than two colleges. Whilst this could be settled by an academic debate, or by simply having a civil and logical parlay with each other, the collegiate Wizards would rather settle things in the dungeon!

The result of this is Multi-player Dungeon Bowl! All the chaos and excitement of a regular game of Dungeon Bowl *(if you can ever refer to Dungeon Bowl as a 'regular' game! - Ed)* but with another two teams thrown into the mix, adding to the unpredictability of the game! Naturally, such spectacles are a hit with fans and are regularly snapped up for special Cabalvision shows where sportscasters can attempt to call all the action from every room for the entertainment of those watching at home!

This section allows coaches to combine multiple sets of Dungeon Bowl in order to create a larger dungeon for four teams to compete for victory in. If you are looking for a more unique Dungeon Bowl experience, or simply want to get as many coaches involved as possible, then setting up some Multi-player Dungeon Bowl is ideal. It can also play as an interesting twist for a league final with the top four teams competing for the ultimate prize.

Over the next few pages we are going to explain everything you need to know to begin playing Multi-player Dungeon Bowl. From setting up a larger dungeon, to how a team wins when there are four End Zones to consider, and any other tweaks that are needed to make your games of Multi-player Dungeon Bowl run as smoothly as possible.

**[SETTING UP THE DUNGE]ON**

**A**s you might expect, there are a few changes to how to go about setting up the dungeon when playing a multi-player game. After all, there are four teams rather than two!

Much like a standard game, this should be a collaborative effort between all players. The aim of this should be to create an interesting and diverse dungeon that all players will enjoy playing across. Remember, at this stage of the game it is not yet a competition!

Whilst players are free to make the dungeon look however they wish, and we encourage them to work together to make a balanced playing area that doesn't inherently give one player a better chance, there are a few rules that govern how the dungeon should be laid out.

**[PLACING THE END] ZONES**

When all players are happy with how the dungeon is laid out, the four End Zones should be placed These should be spread out around the edges of the dungeon as equidistantly as possible.

Players are free to set up their dungeon however they wish, though if you are struggling for ideas then we have provided a few example layouts for you on the next page that you can use to quickly set up your games.

 **Between the various team's  play styles and the endless  combinations of dungeons, no  two games of Dungeon Bowl  are the same!**

![](almanac_2021/media/image26.jpeg) 
 

When creating the dungeon, it should contain at least 6 corridor pieces, at least 6 small rooms, at least 2 large rooms and, of course, the 4 End Zones - although these are not placed until the very end of creating the dungeon.

When creating a dungeon for a game of Multi-player Dungeon Bowl, it is likely that players will be using tiles from multiple sets of Dungeon Bowl. This is, of course, fine. However, it should be noted that each type of room may only be used once in the dungeon.

There can only be one Armoury, Sewer, or Dragon Youngling's Lair for example.

**[WINNING THE GAME]**

Much like a standard game of Dungeon Bowl, the objective here is to traverse the dungeon, locate the game ball hidden in one of the six Chests, and then score that all-important touchdown to seal the win. However, there is the question of where teams need to score that touchdown with the fact that there are now four End Zones rather than the usual two.

In a game of Multi-player Dungeon Bowl, a team can score the game-winning touchdown in any of the three opposing team's End Zones. This may end up with multiple teams trying to score a touchdown in the same End Zone; this is fine, and in fact adds to the urgency and excitement of the game!

**[CHESTS AND PORTALS]**

After the dungeon has been set up, the Chests and Portals need to be placed just like in a standard game. In a two-player game, coaches simply alternate placing Chests then Portals until they have all been placed on the board. However, this doesn't quite work when there are four players.

The first thing that needs to be done is to determine the order in which coaches get to place either a Chest or Portal. To do this, each player rolls a D6 to determine the order, with any coaches that scored the same re-rolling to see which of them places first.

 *For example, when determining the order for placing  the Chests and Portals, Rob rolls a 2, Xavier rolls  a 6, and Jay and Nicolas both roll a 4. As Jay and  Nicolas have both rolled the same, they both re-roll;  this time, Jay rolls a 1 and Nicolas rolls a 3. This  means that the order for placing is Xavier, Nicolas,  Jay and finally Rob.*

The first coach places the first Chest following all of the usual rules as outlined in the *Dungeon Bowl* rulebook, followed by the other coaches in order. The final two Chests are placed by the coaches that were first and second in the placing order.

After all the Chests have been placed, it is time to place the Portals. Portals 1 and 2 are placed by the coaches that were third and fourth in the placing order, following all of the usual rules as outlined in the *Dungeon Bowl* rulebook. The final four Portals are placed in order (from 3 to 6), each placed by a different coach in the order determined by the placing order.

This will result in each coach placing three items,- either two Chests and one Portal, or one Chest and two Portals.

 *Continuing with our example, Xavier will place the  first Chest, followed by Nicolas, Jay, Rob and then  Xavier and Nicolas again. Portal 1 will be placed by  Jay, Portal 2 by Rob, Portal 3 by Xavier, Portal 4 by  Nicolas, Portal 5 by Jay and Portal 6 by Rob.*

**[TURN ORDER]**

In a two-player game of Dungeon Bowl, the teams simply alternate turns. However, this doesn't quite work for a four-player game and so a new system is needed when playing Multi-player Dungeon Bowl.

After the board has been set up, End Zones have been placed, and each coach has deployed their starting teams, coaches need to determine the order in which they take their turns. Unlike a standard game of Dungeon Bowl, a game of Multi-player Dungeon Bowl is divided into a series of game turns.

At the start of each game turn, each coach rolls a D6. The coach that scores the highest will have the first team turn during that game turn, followed by the other coaches depending on how high they scored. Coaches that rolled the same should re-roll to see which of them goes before the other.

After each coach has had one team turn, the game turn comes to an end and the next one begins. The process repeats itself and all coaches roll again as described above. This may result in one team going first in one game turn, and then last in the next; or perhaps having the last turn in one game turn, and then getting the first in the next. This is fine, and is all part of the unpredictability of Multi-player Dungeon Bowl!

*For example, in the first game turn Rob rolls a 6, Jay rolls a 4, Xavier rolls a 3, and Nicolas rolls a 1. This means that for this game turn the order each coach takes their team turn is Rob, Jay, Xavier, Nicolas. In the second game turn, Rob and Xavier roll a 4, Jay rolls a 2 and Nicolas rolls a 6. As Rob and Xavier both rolled a 4, they must re-roll; this time Rob rolls a 5 and Xavier rolls a 3. This means that the order each coach takes their team turn this time is Nicolas, Rob, Xavier, Jay.*

**[OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE ASSISTS]**

**W**hilst all the players from all the opposition teams are considered opposition players, it is important to note that they are still not going to help each other out - after all, every team is the opposition to every other team!

As such there is an important clarification to make in regards to both offensive and defensive assists.

Players can only provide an offensive assist to players from their own team. They cannot provide offensive assists if an opposition player from
one team is performing a Block action or Foul action against an opposition
player from another opposing team - no matter how much they may want to!

If you do decide to change the

 ![](almanac_2021/media/image30.jpeg) 
 ![](almanac_2021/media/image31.jpeg) 
 

*Example: Here, the Dwarf Blitzer (College of Fire) is making a Block action against the Dark Elf Lineman (College of Shadows). The Dwarf Blocker Lineman may provide an offensive assist as it is on the same team as the Dwarf Blitzer. The Black Orc (College of Metal) may not provide an offensive assist as they are not from the same team as the Dwarf Blitzer.*

*Example: Here, the Dark Elf Lineman (College of Shadow) is making a Block action against the Dwarf Blitzer (College of Fire). The Dwarf Blocker Lineman may provide an defensive assist as it is on the same team as the Dwarf Blitzer. The Black Orc (College of Metal) may not provide a defensive assist as they are not from the same team as the Dwarf Blitzer.*

number of teams then you will need to slightly tweak the way in which you determine who places the Chests and Portals so that it works for the number of players you have.

RE[FEREE RULE]S

**The rules presented in this article are designed to give coaches an alternative way to represent the various Referees and officials that oversee a game of Blood Bowl. If you decide to use the rules presented here, then the rules for being Sent-off for committing a Foul action (as per page 63 of the *Blood Bowl* rulebook) will be replaced by an alternative version found later on in this
article.**

**CHOOSING A REF**

When using these rules, coaches will need to choose which Referee they
are going to use. This should be agreed on by both players or rolled for
randomly. At the end of this article, you will find rules for two unique Referees,
Redkur Forgebeard and Einos Lawkeeper, each with their own set of
characteristics, Skills, Traits and special rules. However, if you wish to use a generic
Referee in your game, then use the following characteristics instead:

[Characteristic MA ST AG PA AV]

Referee 5 2 3+ - 8+

Generic Referees have no additional Skills, Traits or special rules.

**DEPLOYING THE REF**

When setting up for a Drive, the Referee is always deployed after both
teams have set up but before the kick-off. The Referee is deployed in the
kicking team's half and must be placed adjacent to a Sideline and as close to
the Line of Scrimmage as possible. The coach of the kicking team may decide
which Sideline the Referee is deployed adjacent to.

**MOVING THE REF**

The Referee will always move after both teams have taken a turn - for example, initially, the Referee would move after the receiving team and
the kicking team have both had their turn 1, and then again after the
receiving team and the kicking team have had their turn 2, and so on.

When the Referee has their turn, they will try to move towards where
the action is thickest. To move the Referee, place the Throw-in template
over the Referee, pointing towards either Sideline or End Zone, in a direction
towards the ball. Then, roll a D6 and move the Referee one square in that
direction. Repeat this process a number of times equal to the Referee's MA. If a
Referee would move into a square containing a player or the ball, then they do
not move into that square and their turn will immediately end. The Referee
will ignore all Tackle Zones when they move, and they do not have a Tackle Zone themself.

Referees never provide assists of any kind, and if the ball would land
in the square they occupy, then it will automatically scatter from that
square.

**[BEING SENT-OFF]**

As we mentioned earlier, being Sent-off for committing a Foul action works slightly differently when there is a Referee physically on the pitch. Essentially, a Foul action committed whilst the Referee is nearby will be much easier for them to spot. Conversely, Foul actions committed further away from the Referee will be less likely to be spotted, if noticed at all. A particularly sneaky player might be able to get away with a number of devious Fouls if the Referee is elsewhere on the pitch!

Whenever a player makes a Foul action, they will not be Sent-off if they roll a double for the Armour roll or a double for the Injury roll. Instead, after the Foul action has been made, count the number of squares between the player committing the Foul action and the Referee, and roll a D6. The chart below states what score on the D6 will result in the player being Sent-off by the Referee. As you might expect, the closer the Foul was to the Referee, the more likely the player will be Sent-off!

  ------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
  **Squares to the Referee**            **Score to be Sent-off**

  1                                     2 +

  2-3                                   3+

  4-5                                   4 +

  6-7                                   5+

  8-9                                   6+
  ------------------------------------- ---------------------------------

If the Foul action was committed 10 or more squares away from the Referee, then the player will not be Sent- off at all - the Referee is clearly too preoccupied with what is going on around them!

**[BLOCKING THE REF]**

Naturally, some players don't take too kindly to the Referee 'interfering' with the more violent aspects of the game. In fact, they take issue with some rulekeeper telling them who they can and can't punch, and that it's not fair to step on a downed opponent. It\'s not uncommon for such players to 'mistime' a tackle and instead take down the Ref, which itself often leads to an all-out brawl when the rest of the players realise there is no longer a killjoy Referee to get in the way of some proper, bone-crunching plays!

Players from either team may declare a Block action on the Referee in the same manner as they would against an opposition player, which may result in the Referee being Stunned, KO'd or even killed! Openly blocking a Referee isn't without risk, however; a player that does so may find that the Referee hits back. Regardless, brazenly breaking the rules and putting the boot in on the Referee will undoubtedly result in a red card - if the Referee is still standing to show one, of course!

Any player that makes a Block action, Foul action, Stab Special action or Chainsaw Attack Special action against a Referee will automatically be Sent-off if the action does not result in a Stunned, KO'd or Casualty! result on the Referee. Players Sent-off in this way may never Argue the Call.

If a Referee is pushed into the crowd, then they do not risk Injury by the Crowd like a normal player - though you should still make an Armour roll to see if the Referee is affected by the initial Block action, if required. Instead, if the Referee has not been Stunned, KO'd or removed as a Casualty, then they will re-enter the pitch from a Sideline as close to the Line of Scrimmage as possible, in a place chosen by the coach whose team did not push the Referee off the pitch. If the Referee's armour was not broken when they were pushed off the pitch, then the player that pushed them off will be Sent-off as normal. This does not apply if the Referee was pushed off the pitch as the result of a Chain Push.

Whilst a Referee is off the pitch, Stunned, KO'd or removed as a Casualty, players cannot be Sent-off for any reason until the Referee is back on the pitch. This may even mean that players with the Secret Weapon trait are not Sent-off at the end of a drive!

**REFEREE PROFILES**

Much like Stat Players, some Referees have become s\\ [iknw]{.smallcaps} mows with the game of Blood Bowl and can be just as well known as some players for their antics or xenotimes 'questionable\* refereeing style.

**Here** we present the rules for two unique Referees (one Elf and one Dwarf) you can use in your games.

 **[MA ST AG PA AV]**

**Einos Lawkeeper 6** 2 3+ - 7 +

**Skills & Traits: Dodge**

**Special Rules: "Err, I think you'll find\..."** Players that are Sent off by Einos Lawkeeper cannot Argue the Call under any circumstances.

**Hopefully, this article has given you some extra ways to get the most from your games of Blood Bowl and provided you with another exciting option to use in your leagues. Referees can certainly add that extra level of depth and strategy to your game and overall are a lot of fun! Will you choose to follow the rules (at least while the Ref is watching), or will you try to take them out of the game so that your players can wreak carnage on the pitch without risk of reprisal?**

**MA [ST AG PA] AV\_ Redkur Forgebeard 4 3 3+ - 8 +**

**Skills & Traits;** Block

**Special Rules: By the Book** - Players that commit a Foul action suffer a -1 penalty to the D6 when rolling to see if they are Sent-off for being near Redkur Forgebeard.

**JIM JOHNSON'S STATISTICS SECTION**

for those fortunate enough to win it. Over the past forty years there have been many great matches that have taken place at the hallowed Emperor\'s Bowl to crown a champion. Of course, with forty years worth of matches having taken place, there are plenty of records to hold - both good and not so good! From the likes of which team has won the coveted trophy the most, to the team that has scored the most touchdowns in a single game, to statistics that nobody wants such as which team has had the most finals without winning the Blood Bowl.

Of course, when it comes to statistics there is no finer brain than the legendary Jim Johnson. The bloodsucking broadcaster is a connoisseur of interesting facts, and he has joined us in this section to give us the low-down on some of the more fascinating facts and figures from the history of the Blood Bowl final.

**MOST BLOOD BOWL TITLES: REIKLAN[D REAVERS (6) ]**When it comes to the number of victories, it is, of course, the Reikland Reavers who have lifted the trophy the most number of times. On six separate occasions the Reavers have been crowned as the best team in the known world, defeating a who's who of teams in the process. The likes of the Athelorn Avengers, Darkside Cowboys and the Dwarf Giants have all fallen to the Reavers in a series of thrilling finals.

**MOST BLOOD BOWL FINAL APPEARANCES: REIKLAND [REAVERS (14)] **It may come as little surprise that the Reikland Reavers have won the title the most when you consider that they have participated in the final a record 14 times - that\'s a whopping eight more than the second most appearances, the Gouged Eye!

Statistically, the Reikland Reavers are actually more likely to lose the final than win it, having won only 42.8% of the finals they have participated in. This also means that the Reavers hold the record for the most finals lost at eight.

**MOST BLOOD BOWL FINAL APPEARANCES WITHOUT VICTORY: WARHAMMERERS, LUSTRIA CROAKERS, DA DEFF SKWAD (2) **Three different teams had the undistinguished honour of featuring in two different Blood Bowl finals and then losing them both. The Lizardmen of the Lustria Croakers achieved this first in 2479 and 2482, followed by the Warhammerers, who lost their second final in 2486. The most recent addition to this less than illustrious group is Da Deff Skwad, who managed to lose two Blood Bowl finals in three years!

**CONSECUTIVE BLOOD BOWL TITLES: SKAVENBLIGHT SCRAMBLERS [(2477 & 2478]) **Only a single team in the history of the Blood Bowl has managed to successfully defend their title, the ever-popular Skavenblight Scramblers. The Orcland Raiders came close to matching this feat in 2484, but they claimed that the Skavenblight Scramblers spiked their team's refreshments with ground- up warpstone just to protect their record. Of course, nothing has ever been proven!

**MOST TOUCHDOWNS (SINGLE GAME): SKAVENBLIGHT [SCRAMBLERS (6)] **The Skavenblight Scramblers also hold the record for the most touchdowns scored in a single game with six. The unfortunate team on the receiving end of such a defeat? The Evil Gits. The Gits may have scored first, but couldn\'t stop the Scramblers from running in six touchdowns in succession. The Gits only scored their second touchdown because the Skaven players were too busy laughing at them to bother tackling the ball carrier!

**MOST TOUCHDOWNS (CUMULATIVE): REIKLAND [REAVERS (25)] **It\'s not much of a surprise considering the number of Blood Bowl finals they have been in that the Reikland Reavers hold the record for the most cumulative touchdowns at 25; an average of 1.79 touchdowns per game. It\'s a record that will likely stand for quite a while; the second highest scoring team, the Skavenblight Scramblers, are a whole eight touchdowns behind on 17.

**HIGHEST AVERAGE TOUCHDOWNS (24- GAMES):**

**[ATHELORN AVENGERS (3.5)]**

Whilst the Creeveland Crescents have the highest average with only one final played, this is largely down to the fact they played the Greenfield Grasshuggers. When you take teams that have played in multiple finals, the team with the highest average touchdowns are the Athelorn Avengers. When these dancing and prancing Wood Elves take to the pitch you can expect plenty of touchdowns that's for sure!

**MOST TOUCHDOWNS CONCEDED (CUMULATIVE): REIKLAND [REAVERS (31)] **Again, this should come as little surprise seeing that the Reikland Reavers have appeared in more than double the number of finals of any other team. Even so, the Reavers have conceded an average of 2.21 touchdowns per game for a grand total of 31! Odds are that if your team meets the Reavers in the final, they will likely score a couple of touchdowns without too much of an issue!

**BIGGEST WIN: CREEVELAND CRESCENTS 5-0 GREENFIELD [GRASSHUGGERS] **When the Greenfield Grasshuggers somehow managed to reach the XVI Blood Bowl final, half of the Moot bought tickets (and the other half snuck in anyway!). However, the more serious Blood Bowl fans probably wished they hadn\'t as their team were pummelled 5-0 by the Creeveland Crescents. Not that this bothered the Grasshuggers too much, most of them were just glad of a good day out and a record-breaking half-time buffet to celebrate reaching the final!

**LEAST TOUCHDOWNS BY A WINNING TEAM:**

**[OLDHEIM OGRES (1)] **The Oldheim Ogres hold the record for the least touchdowns scored by a winning team, scoring just one in 2475. For most of the game, the Ogres simply beat up the Reikland Reavers, whilst one Ogre fell asleep on the ball! Luckily, they woke up with minutes to spare in time to boot both the ball and an unsuspecting Gnoblar into the end zone for a momentous victory!

**MOST TOUCHDOWNS BY A LOSING [TEAM; ATHELORN AVENGERS (4) ]**Scoring four touchdowns in a single game is a truly brilliant feat; so imagine being the team that scored four in the final of the Blood Bowl, only to still lose the match! That is exactly what happened to the Athelorn Avengers in 2499 when they played the Reikland Reavers in the highest scoring game in Blood Bowl final history. They may have lost 5-4, but the Avengers still maintain they looked fabulous doing it!

**MOST FINALS WITHOUT SCORING: [DADEFFSKWAD(2)] **Da Deff Skwad hold the unadmirable accolade of being the only team to fail to score a single touchdown on two separate occasions. Though their offence had been ruthlessly brutal along the way to the final, something always seems to go awry when they play at the Emperor\'s Bowl; losing 4-0 and 3-0 respectively on their two appearances. Of course, this is something Da Deff Skwad hope to rectify should they ever reach the final again.

![](almanac_2021/media/image42.jpeg) 
 

**HIGHEST AVERAGE TOUCHDOWNS**

**CONCEDED (24- GAMES); WARHAMMERERS, DA DEFF [SKWAD (3.5)] **Whilst three teams have conceded a higher average number of touchdowns, the Shiretown Stuffers and Greenfield Grasshuggers (5) and the Evil Gits (6), they have each only played a single game. The two teams with the leakiest defence in multiple Blood Bowl finals are the Warhammerers and Da Deff Skwad. Conceding 3.5 touchdowns per game, there is little wonder why neither team has ever lifted the Blood Bowl trophy!

![](almanac_2021/media/image43.jpeg) 
 

 **At the start of a new season, one thing is for certain and that  is that each team will unveil a brand new kit for collectors  and fans to snap up. Some teams simply make a few small  changes to their classic kits, perhaps changing the colour of the
 trim,  or updating their shirts with a brand new sponsor. Other owners make  radical changes to their team's kit in an attempt to rebrand their
 team,  or simply give them a brand new look in an effort to help fans forget  the previous season's failings!**

 **R**egardless of the reasons, we here at *Spike! Journal* follow
 these  fluctuating fashions with great interest - after all, it provides a
 great  topic of debate within the offices1 We are always excited to see
 which  teams have come up with the season\'s next big fashion icon, and which
 teams  have simply slapped a new price tag on their existing kit, and tried
 to flog it to  their fans as their new daring 'retro' look

**[TATZINA SAYS,..] **"Well I must admit to being quite fond of Necromantic Horror teams. They are so calm and collected, and just seem to have it all together. Not literally, of course, limbs are always falling off!

But that is in itself so bold and daring; I love it!

For me, the stand-out kit in Sylvania this year has to be that of the Wolfenburg Crypt-Stealers. It is the perfect blend of bright pumpkin hues, dark sinister blacks, with just a dash of vibrant green to really make this kit hard to miss. And it must be said that no-one accessorises like the Crypt- Stealers; pumpkins are just so hot right now!\"

Now, when it comes to the kits of the Imperial Nobility, I was naturally drawn to the exquisite example of the Bdgenhafen Barons. The combination of a crisp white with a deep burgundy, all topped off with the rich golden armour; it is simply wonderful. If the Barons wanted to give the impression of great wealth then my goodness did they manage it!"

**TATZINA SAYS\... **\"It\'s not just the teams that have caught my attention on the gridiron this year, there have been numerous stars that have strutted their stuff with their own unique looks and made us gaze in awe at their fabulous and fantastic attires!

 stunning addition of half a Zombie on  his back. Such a daring look has not  gone unnoticed this year, and plenty  of ambitious Zombies have written to  Varag requesting to be considered for  his next accessory.

 Of course, when we talk about style  we have to mention Griff Oberwald.  The legendary player looks right at  home in the colour of the Bogenhafen  Barons, and all that gold certainly  fits in with his well-earned ego.  They do say in fashion to never work  with animals, but Griff has put his  doubters to rest with the addition of  his feathered friend.

 Flesh or fur? That is the question  that has divided Undead fans this  year. Of course, we are talking about  the ongoing debate of who has proved  to be the most stylish: Frank \*n\' Stein  or Wilhelm Chaney. Naturally, this  is impossible to answer, both are  big fashion icons right now. It all  comes down to the preference of the  individual, though you can't go wrong  with either.\"
